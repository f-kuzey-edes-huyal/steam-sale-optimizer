"Counter-Strike 2 is a sleek upgrade built on the Source 2 engine, offering sharper visuals, improved lighting, and smoother gameplay. The new sub-tick system enhances responsiveness, and dynamic smoke grenades add fresh tactical depth. While it feels more like a refined update than a true sequel, longtime fans will appreciate the cleaner UI and updated audio. However, some legacy features and maps are still missing, and performance issues have been reported. Despite its rocky start, CS2 retains the core competitive essence that made CS:GO a classic. It‚Äôs a polished evolution, not a reinvention‚Äîsolid for veterans and newcomers alike.",0.179004329004329,1749591411,True,730

The worst PvP experience I have ever played in a game. It feels like there is no end goal besides hoarding resources. Could be cool but I really don't think it will ever reach that point.,-0.21249999999999997,1749591757,False,1172710
"Game is legit, great Dune vibes with enough content to sink your teeth into. Funcom did a great job creating systems that fit the Dune IP. So far nothing seems out of place or cheesy to me. The quests are voice acted and it's done well, the writing is good. There are multiple classes with skill trees adding diversity of character. Scavenging is engaging. Crafting is not bad. There's a combination of PVE and PVP zones on the same server, the deep desert is PVP. You can lose everything to a worm, so they stay scary and have meaning. If you're looking for a focus on building, maybe play enshrouded. This game is about Dune, it isn't possible to build anything that doesn't look like Dune. Combat is not ground-breaking, but suits the game. There is always something to do, if you're familiar with other games in the genre it will seem familiar in many ways, but that's not to say Dune doesn't bring unique qualities. Game is gud",0.1065217391304348,1749591736,True,1172710

The best game I have played in years. At first I was unsure of the melee combat but it is amazing. The early videos did not do it justice. It becomes real smooth and fun once you pick it up. Plus there seems to be unlimited things to do. Highly recommended.,0.32625000000000004,1749591656,True,1172710
"Me compr√© la versi√≥n completa del juego y no he podido jugar online. No me deja iniciar sesi√≥n. Al mirar en foros he visto que hay much√≠sima gente a la que le pasa lo mismo y veo que no hay soluci√≥n por parte de los desarrolladores. Me parece vergonzoso que juegos as√≠ todav√≠a se publiciten en la tienda y se presenten con tanto bombo y platillo para que despu√©s no funcionen. Y como he probado muchas formas que he visto para poder arreglar el problema, ya no puedo recibir reembolso porque me he pasado del tiempo. En fin, no recomiendo para nada el juego aqu√≠ en Steam y me gustar√≠a que fuera retirado de la tienda para que a otras personas no les pase lo mismo que a m√≠. Disfrutad de este juego en Game Pass o en consola, porque aqu√≠ solo es un robo de dinero, adem√°s que la versi√≥n premium no te trae todos los DLCs. Tanto dinero se gasta uno para esto. DECEPCIONANTE.",-0.4,1749587945,False,1551360
