[Scraping information of all games from Steam with Python](https://medium.com/codex/scraping-information-of-all-games-from-steam-with-python-6e44eb01a299)

"Does SteamDB have an API? [https://steamdb.info/faq/#how-are-we-getting-this-information]
In short, no. We believe if you need to get Steam data, you can get it from Steam directly using their WebAPI or using libraries like SteamKit (see above).

SteamDB is a community website and we do not make money, and maintaining the site is already enough work for us. Creating a good API is a lot of work and a big vector for abuse which we are not equipped to deal with.

Take a look at "How are we getting this information?" question above for more information about getting information from Steam directly."

# Notes for Myself

- I have to change my data scraping criteria. Selecting only the most recently published games may not be the best approach. I need to rethink it.
- There are many free games. From what Iâ€™ve learned, some of them use different strategies like making the game free to play but charging players for in-game items such as clothes or weapons. Others earn money through ads, especially on mobile platforms.
