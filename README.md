# Notes for Myself

- I have to change my data scraping criteria. Selecting only the most recently published games may not be the best approach. I need to rethink it.
- There are many free games. From what Iâ€™ve learned, some of them use different strategies like making the game free to play but charging players for in-game items such as clothes or weapons. Others earn money through ads, especially on mobile platforms.
- Can I scrape how many copies were sold for each game ID? If I can't get this information, can I find something that is strongly related to the number of copies sold? I can try to find a dataset that includes the number of copies sold. Then, I can look for a feature that has a high correlation with it using the features I already collected.

- Reviews are in multiple languages, so we need to find a way to handle that. Also, consider how to use these reviews effectively. Should we use a multimodal model that processes both text and other features, or convert the reviews into numerical scores like sentiment polarity?
-  I will need the ```reviewer_id``` for database normalization, as I aim to include 20 reviews per game.
