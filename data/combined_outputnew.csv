Esse joghttps:store.steampowered.comapp1113000Persona_4_Goldeno com certeza deixou uma marca em mim, assim como os outros deixaram. Os personagens com certeza são o ponto mais alto desse jogo, todos os seus companheiros são bem presentes durante a história, e com exceção de um, todos são bem agradáveis de fazer os social links e assistir eles interagindo entre si, esse jogo inteiro passa uma vibe muito mais ''alegre'' do que todos os outros e você sente bastante isso em todo mundo. Eles tem bastante aquela energia de ''amizade boba de amigos de um anime de escola'' e mesmo que isso dava uma cansada em alguns pontos da história, eu ainda curti. Dito isso, spoilerMeu Deus como eu fiquei de saco cheio do Teddie várias vezes. Acho que isso é simplesmente um estilo de humor que os japoneses gostam que não desce em mim, mas esse negócio de ficar, ''nossa, eu quero muito ver minhas amigas ficarem peladas e namorar com elas, haha!'' começa a encher o saco. Se fosse uma vez ou outra eu não veria problema, esses momentos fazem parte dos outros jogos também, mas depois de um tempo, parece que o Teddie só consegue abrir a boca pra falar disso, e as vezes ficava até pior já que o Yosuke entrava nessa pira junto. Depois da metade pro fim do jogo, eu só tava achando ele muito esquisitão do que qualquer outra coisa.spoiler Bom, mas excluindo essa parte, gostei bastante dos personagens! A história do jogo consegue te prende bastante, principalmente da metade pro fim, onde todas as peças do mistério começam a se encaixar, sempre que eu abria o jogo eu ficava naquela mini ansiedade pra saber o que iria acontecer em seguida, e adorei o antagonista principal, provavelmente meu personagem favorito do jogo inteiro! Toda a estética do jogo no combate, nas músicas e quando você está só passeando na cidade construindo os social links é muito marcante, era muito normal eu simplesmente ficar balançando a cabeça no ritmo da música enquanto eu jogava. Quanto ao combate, joguei o jogo inteiro no difícil e foi um desafio bem agradável pra mim que sempre deixar os jogos um pouco mais difíceis que o normal, vencer os bosses principais era bem satisfatório. Em geral, jogo muito bom! Entendo como esse foi o jogo que realmente colocou a Atlus no mapa e como ele conseguiu tocar tantas pessoas, se você jogou e gostou de ter jogado tanto o 3 quanto o 5, aqui tem tudo que você gosta! One of the best games, I love it. Granted there are somethings that have aged poorly but it is just a nice game even with that Un hermoso juego, con personajes increíbles, una historia para recordar, un buen sistema de peleas y un hermoso final.

Cпустя время он решил расширить свои земли, что у него и получилось. У него в своем городе земли были довольно не плодородны, да и руд не бывало. Задумался феодал и понял, что нужно возводить города на новых участках, там и земли и руды прекрасны. Все шло у него, как по маслу. В городе овцы и разнообразие пищи, в корчме крестьяне бурно радовались элю. И вот через время возвел поселения на местах иноземных и решил между ними бартер устроить. Все через время у него понемногу случалось. Город богател, шло 31 лето, июнь и эта конченная игра блять крашнулась и удалила мой сейв. 600р заплатил за галимое говно Like many have written, this is an unpolished game with potential to be okay. After several hours playing and several hours researching how to perform better in the game, my conclusion is you can do everything right... and still fail. Not much to do besides micro villagers between jobs by clicking on buildings, which is more irritating than fun at least banished had a menu for that...it's very easy to make an army and take over the map, maybe wait for the update as there is nothing too fun or unique about this game ATM and it seems to be missing tonnes of content, it's kind of a mashup of banished, foundation and ostriv but they are all better Le jeu est bon mais il manque VRAIMENT de end game. On peut finir une partie en 3 a 4 heures si on joue bien. Un peu plus de technologie ou de niveaux de developpement auraient ete agreables. Neanmoins je laisse un avis positif pour le potentiel que le jeu a, il est en early apres tout.. Absolutely love this game. Never have really been into city builders but I keep finding myself coming back to this game and binging it for weeks straight. I do wish the updates would come out a little quicker, but I understand its a small developer.

This is what it's like to live in Brazil Kenshi can oddly be summarized as Morrowind, if you removed all of the quests from the game, replaced every cliff racer with daedric enemies, and then add in awful performance that cause constant loading screens from running around the map alongside bugs and other issues that will delete half of your base, get your characters killed or even remove them entirely, break your saves outright and sometimes just crash your game when trying to load a save. It's unfortunately a deceptively shallow game that is held together with rubber bands. There is a lot going on in the World of Kenshi according to dialogue from its inhabitants, but in reality its all barren and artificial. There are several different factions that have their own issues and conflicts but they are all confined to their own little bubbles and will never reach out beyond them unless you force them too, which just results in a few different npcs spawning in different areas. You can run around and explore the handful of towns spread out across this very large, dead world, and all you'll find are npcs that are flagged to fight other npcs and a few unique characters with barely a paragraphs worth of dialogue. You can interact with all of these happenings by getting beat up by bandits, or trading items that can't be used by npcs to merchants who, in the non existent economy, restock their wallet and inventory every day, or sneak around and steal from said merchants, and that's really it. There are copy and pasted ruins to find with items tailored for the tech tree research and junk that can't be used for anything other than selling, but otherwise nothing interesting to find. No underground arenas to participate in, no local attractions to sight see, no gathering of nobility to make fun of the poor, nor any grand cathedrals with altars for the pious to grovel beneath. Just more desert and more towns filled nearly identical shops and inns. Engaging with these few activities Kenshi has to offer isn't that meaningful either. The game functions mostly like an RTS so everything plays itself with the only real input from the player being minor positioning and kiting which isn't even that necessary. This creates a very boring gameplay loop that overstays its welcome due to the slow and one dimensional ways to level up your characters. Leveling up any of your characters major skills in combat, crafting, etc. will take dozens of hours if you don't explicitly focus on grinding them and have other priorities than just fighting the locals, or crafting the same cheap gear while you sit on your phone or fight the games performance issues trying to do other in game tasks. You could circumvent the grind by amassing a large number of people, but then comes the issue of annoying micromanaging of inventories, hunger and combing over everyone to check their health. Really the only thing left is the base building side of the game, but that highlights the abysmal ai pathfinding with characters getting stuck on rocks, phasing through walls and getting stuck, or just not doing anything because a small box in the back corner of the room is blocking them from entering the building at all, or the rudimentary job system causing logistical standstills with your workers just not doing things sometimes. There is charm in its ideas and passion behind its creation, but Kenshi, devoid of the abstract, is just a mechanical and technical mess that feels like its wasting your time by pretending its ambition and scope are reality while gating the meaningful and interesting content with a tedious grind that prevent's you from fully experiencing the world presented and hiding most of it in nooks and crevices that blend in with identical ruins and lifeless structures. when running away from anything tap R, thank me later juego culiao me vicio XD You ever wanted to die, but never wanted to actually do it.

Ceu fiquei muito impressionado em como No Mans Sky melhorou muito com o tempo. Quando joguei pela primeira vez, confesso que foi meio decepcionante. O jogo era meio sem graça, NPC's vazios, muitos bugs, algumas mecânicas não funcionavam depois de um tempo eu voltei pra dar uma chance e... nossa, mudou da agua pro vinho, te juro Hoje em dia posso dizer que: é o melhor jogo de exploração espacial que existe. Os desenvolvedores realmente cuidam do game, da pra ver que eles amam o que estão fazendo, o que pra mim que tbm sou dev, chega a ser emocionante. Toda hora tem atualização nova, coisa melhorando, conteúdo sendo adicionado... é bonito de ver mano. O que mais gosto é a sensação de estar sozinho naquele universo gigante, é intimidador e ao mesmo tempo um convite pra desvendar aquela imensidão. Ficar viajando de planeta em planeta, lendo arquivos antigos, descobrindo coisas sobre outras raças, enfrentando as sentinelas quando dá vontade de confusão... ou só melhorando minha nave e os equipamentos... ha e você vai aprendendo a se comunicar com outras raças tbm. E mano, dá até pra ter uma frota inteira de navesfragatas!! Depois dessa atualização que adicionou frotas, pra onde eu vou eu pouso minha nave capital bem na atmosfera do planeta, ai ela vem no hiperespaço e em seguida as fragatas... puts q visão. O jogo te dá uma liberdade absurda. Você faz o que quiser, no seu ritmo, do seu jeito tlg. É realmente um universo inteiro pra explorar, e chega a arrepiar. Se você curte explorar, ficar de boa no espaço, descobrir mistérios e montar suas próprias aventuras, eu recomendo demais!!! E para os que gostam de jogar com amigos, da pra jogar multiplayer, e entre plataformas tambemeu jogo com meu amigo pelo PC e ele no PS4. em fim, recomendo forte! es ist nicht möglich dieses spiel mit Freude zu spielen wenn es jede halbe st. abstürzt , ich kann nicht mehr !!!!!!!!!!!!

É realmente uma pena que um jogo tão bom esteja sendo manchado por má conduta de determinadas pessoas. I love the immersion in this game. I only play sandbox mode, since I play on linux, but I prefer it this way. Sandbox is super configurable, so you can set the experience you prefer. Very nice game here, . GOOD its a good fun game. ofthen get a big jumpscare when a random zombiepuppet come out of nowhere or at moments i dont expect. the human NPC's and kinda strong. and there is something called a abandoned bunker, that have like the best loot. but holy F that place is scary and intense, specialy when new to it. the game have some learning curve to it but if you actualy fallow the tutorial in singleplayersandbox mode you wil understand the game very fast. DO NOT SKIP THE TUTORIAL! notting more stupid than, i dont know how to play, why is it confusing or hard cry baby, than to quit. the game looks really nice and pretty. base building feels limited sadly enough. the weapons seem well balanced, to realisict lvl for the game. good survival and health system. it can be a bit intense at first. little golden vehicle tip. the small little care called the Laika is S tier. it got good storage, base speed, and omfg it drive so nicely and best all terain vehicle on 4 wheels in the game. no maintain is to high for that car. spay it cotton candy pink and you cute the most cute little car ever that can do everything you need. S tier. Golden weapon tip. Bow is main weapon true most the game, as early and end game. final tip, medical skill, Max it out when making character, extremely important skill. actual last tip, dont trust anything or anyone and everything outside the safe zone. everyone can and will kill you. I have almost played 1000 hours in the game SCUM and I can say with confidence that this is one of the best survival games on the market. I would especially like to highlight the Echelon UA server - it has a great atmosphere, great support and stable administration work, creating a truly comfortable environment for playing. Thank you for such high-quality work! I would also like to appeal to the development team with a request - it would be great if the Ukrainian language was added to the game. This would make the game even more accessible and enjoyable for Ukrainian players, and would allow the community to become even more diverse and friendly.

This is good game for you This game totally sucked me in. I got it thinking, Oh cool, Ill build a cute zoo and vibe with the animals. Next thing I know, its 2 am and Im googling what pets go well together in google. Planet Zoo is genuinely one of the best managementbuilding games Ive played. The animals are ridiculously detailedlike, they have personalities and little quirks, and it makes your zoo feel alive. Ive caught myself just sitting there watching the elephants play in the water. No shame. The building system is super powerful. Its not easy at first honestly, it humbled me, but once you figure it out, you can make some insane stuff. Total creative freedom. Want to build a fully themed rainforest sanctuary with custom signs and ambient sounds? Go for it. Want to just plop down pre-built stuff and focus on running the zoo? That works too. What I didnt expect was how much thought goes into caring for the animals. You have to learn what each species needs to be happyterrain, space, food, social groups, enrichment, all of it. Its detailed, but in a fun, addicting way. Also, theres conservation goals and education stuff woven in, which I actually really liked. Makes it feel meaningful, not just like a zoo tycoon game from 2004. Is it perfect? Not quite. The interface can feel a little overwhelming at first, and building with 1,000 pieces can get a little fiddly. But the game keeps getting updated, and the community is awesome if you ever need help or inspiration. If youre into animals, building sims, or just want to create your dream zoo and stress about habitat temperatures, this game is 100 worth it.

The graphics were stunning, and the animals were incredibly cute seriously, I couldnt stop smiling at them. The music and sound design were top-notch and really pulled me into the world. The story had the perfect length, keeping me engaged from start to finish without dragging on. Overall, it was a super fun experience that I genuinely enjoyed. The humor was a huge highlight for me. The AI girls were hilarious and full of personality, and the random in-game ads were so unexpectedly funny I found myself laughing way more than I expected. It gave the game a unique charm that really stood out. The only downside was the platforming. Sometimes when jumping between platforms, it felt like tiny micro-pixels or edge detection issues caused my character to miss the jump or fail to grab a ledge, which could be frustrating.

Tekken 8 tries to be more like the 2d games in its 50 50 guess fest, but street fighter 6 is a way better version of that. I can't speak for the main campaign because no one cares about that shit but the core gameplay is fine for the most part.

I just wish Capcom didnt sideline this game and stopped with the avatar world tour addons that 2 people care about. It's actually really good, it's shame it increases in file size by like 10 gigs every update. I imagine by the end of the games content cycle you'll need an entire Hard Drive just for it.

It means you will be doing mostly the same puzzle over and over again but with different constraints one time you can't choose where you take the photo, one time you are limited in the number of photos taken, etc. Story was also sub-par.

I could recommand the game if the devs could consider stop milking us. I was surprised by how much I liked this game. I thought it would be humdrum based on the half-way greyscale color scheme, but it caught me right up. Classes, levels, tactical combat, choices matter sometimes, but not really that much, professions, missions, some open-world feeling, different paths...it all kind of worked out for a while. It is a surprisingly-well-balanced game. Graphics are a bit underdeveloped, but it might be for ambience. Music is very upbeat-dark-ages. Combat is between simple and complex depending on your party and load-out, and makes sense. The world is well-designed.

Combat is fluid and fun, the world feels alive, and the progression is super satisfying. Whether you're playing solo or with friends, there's always something to do and explore. Highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys survival games with a dark twist. Easily one of my favorite games this year.",5000000.0,10000000.0,7071067.811865473

That is not something I believe anyone is denying. However you can't take all the possible issues and compare them to your experience. Mine has been pretty light in terms of issues or bugs encountered, and definitely within reason for any game I would play and at the time of this writing, the game is still within Early Access. Ark has held a special place in my list of games ever since it's initial release while I was on a shoddy laptop. I would recommend this game to anybody who enjoys Survival games. It's spin on the genre - and the inclusion of Big Reptile - make it an experience even if you play casually. I would recommend any new players hold off on any Flying mounts until they really explore the map, it's gorgeous and such a different experience on the ground than the detached feel you eventually get flying over the map. A gorgeous flight, but you tend to get into that Autopilot of just going from A to B. Walk around, die to Raptors a couple hundred times, live the Ark experience. For fans of Evolved, Ascended has taken Evolved and made it gorgeous, The enhancements to the UI and certain QoL features make this game an amazing remaster.

If you're only going to grab one or two DLCs, I'd recommend this and Biotech. Both are very fun, work in almost all playthroughs, and add significant amounts of new content. Really cool addition to the base game! May not seem as expansive as something like biotech but what it DOES add is a really cool ship on top of some nice features and additions!

If you're thinking about buying this to enjoy the campaign with a friend, I hate to disappoint you but this is not the right place. This Definitive Edition feels more like a quick cash grab than a true reimagining. The co-op experience is shallow, clunky, and clearly an afterthought. The new features barely scratch the surface of what long-time fans were expecting. In fact, there are far better mods out there for the older versions that offer more depth, stability, and love for the original game than this upgraded release ever does. Its cheap, lazy, and full of missed opportunities. The developers might claim it was built with respect for the classic, but it plays like they simply repackaged old content with minimal effort, slapped on a few gimmicks, and hoped nostalgia would do the rest.

What I can say, is that the game rewards you for learning how the bikes handle and pushing that it's limit. That is the point of any racing game attempting simulation. Whether or not they're realistic couldn't tell you or easier to ride than last year I don't really detect that much of a difference, but I am also not at the top of the online lobbies matters less to me than if they are fun and rewarding to pilot - the answer there is: yes. It looks good and sounds good. All the teams, riders, and tracks are faithfully represented. And that's about all the good that I can say. The bare minimum has been done to deliver you a product here. Let me explain. I own most of the MotoGP games on Steam. I have many hours in them. I have a lot of achievements. I also am avid fan of the real thing, and even ride my own motorcycle. I am the target demographic for this title so I feel confident that, should any devs stumble across this, they can get some insight from my review. Career mode is frustrating. You can start in any class, but you are limited to only 4 teams in each. It does not change. This seems like a weird, arbitrary decision to make. I can jump straight to MotoGP but I can't ride for the Aspar team in Moto3? And when you do start progression, there's not a lot of feedback on whether or not you are on your desired career path. I wanted to take a Honda pathway to the top. When offers came in for MotoGP, I had to pick Trackhouse. Then after I was champion in my first season, I was not offered a ride with the factory Aprilia team despite just taking their customer bike to the World Championship. How does this make sense? Just let the players choose. Moreover, the career mode could use a lot of extra depth since the empty online lobbies are certainly not what will keep you coming back to the game. Manager mode is gone and has not returned. Nor have the historical bikes. Nor the recreate-a-moment challenges. Maybe one day. Oh and the AI is still awful and homicidalsuicidal.

За свои деньги в игре много контента. Хоть геймплей и содержит элементы гринда, из-за большого количества персонажей и различных механик играть не скучно. Эта игра лучше по качеству, чем большинство схожих. Визуальный стиль очень приятный. Иногда удивляет сколько в ней мелких разнообразных механик и визуальных деталей, которые прорабатывать было не обязательно. Здесь есть автобатлер, симулятор свиданий с элементами выбора, поиск объектов на экране, замысловатая система прокачки, элементы ресурсного менеджмента, рыбалка, готовка, эмулятор личной переписки, симулятор прикосновений, есть элементы песочницы и наверняка я еще что то забыл h3The protagonist of this game is probably the son of Phoenix Wright and Larry Laffer, as he constantly engages in verbal battles with hot girls and, after winning, takes the girls to bed.h3 h1Overview h1 Love n Life: Happy Student is a sandbox visual novel featuring comprehensive gameplay with playable elements from RPGs, dating simulators, timeresource management, and more. In this game, you play as a third-year college student, who manage to be transfer to the prestigious Lingyun University. There, the protagonist hones his conversational social skills in fights with other students, using a system of equippable items that grant conversation topics. Moreover, through these battles, the protagonist will succeed in capturing the hearts and bedrooms of three captivating main heroines and another 3 side heroines, with whom he engages 28 different passionate encounters, most of which feature high-quality Live 2D animations and lewd SFX, ideal for a fulfilling nighttime manual labor session. h3Storyh3 The narrative is certainly not this title's strong point. It has a fairly generic university harem background with heroines who have extremely flat, stereotypical personalities. For example, there is a cheerful blonde gyaru, a serious student council president, and a seductive, busty teacher. Characters that serve to satisfy different fetishes in the game, but not for a deep story. The progression of the story is unremarkable as well. It features typical slice-of-life events where the protagonist attends classes, helps the heroines complete tasks, and goes on dates with them. Therefore, it is generally better not to pay too much attention to the characters' dialogues and instead enjoy the gameplay and sexual content, which undoubtedly deserve more of your attention and time. h3Gameplayh3 This title is visually quite similar to a sandbox visual novel, as it has different locations that you can explore and visit via a menumini-map. In these locations, you will find the different heroines, who will change places depending on the day and time, as the game borrows this from the time management genre, giving the characters a routine. In addition to the heroines, you can also find NPCs in these places, who can sell you things, offer the protagonist work, or be necessary to complete side missions. As for the gameplay itself, it is mainly divided into two mechanics. The first is dating simulation, where you have to win the affection of the heroines by giving them gifts, going on dates with them, but mainly by completing their missions, which are the most typical, such as finding them in a specific place at a certain time, buying them an item, collecting materials, etc. Once you complete the missions, you unlock the different sex scenes. The second playable part corresponds to the RPG section, as the protagonist has different statistics, such as: impact, stamina, fortitude, impact chance, awareness, and steadfastness, which are explained in the game, but which are basically the basis for the combat conversations that the protagonist has with different characters. These battles are completely automatic, and the player only has to assemble the protagonist's build, equipping objects that grant additional stats and active combat skills. There are a total of 359 different items, so there is a wide range of options, but basically their usefulness is reduced to four different types: charm, which is characterized by powerful attacks; knowledge, which is characterized by large increases but with the possibility of harming you; confidence, for having high levels of endurance; and finally, kindness, which is characterized by allowing you to heal yourself during combat. This item system is what really adds complexity to the gameplay and, therefore, is what can keep you entertained as you try to put together a build that suits your style. It is important to note that these conversational battles, or socialize as the game calls them, are necessary for certain events in the main story and for the heroines, so it is important to have a powerful build as the heroines' levels will increase, making the battles more complicated. h3Sexual contenth3 h3Note: You need to install the 18 Free DLC or you will not see any sexual content.h3 In total, this game has 28 sex scenes, all of which have animations, although 15 of these are full HD Live 2D animations and the remaining 13 are simpler animations that use the in-game character models. Fortunately, in both cases, they feature erotic sound effects and some voice dialogue. As for the quality of these scenes, the Live 2D animations are undoubtedly infinitely better, not only because they have higher quality art that can be appreciated in full screen, but also because the movements are quite fluid and realistic and, together with the atmosphere, music, and sound effects, are extremely suggestive. The animations that use the in-game models are not bad as such, since they also have fluid animations and add an internal view of the heroine's vagina so you can see the moment of ejaculation, but I still prefer the Live 2D. Although one point to note is that despite the quality of the scenes being good, their duration is quite short, lasting a maximum of one minute. As for the sexual fetishes present, there is not much to highlight since most fall into the vanilla category, with blowjobs, boobjobs, vaginal sex, sex toys, threesomes, public sex, bikinis, and some cosplay. So while it is enjoyable content for all players, veterans of the genre may be left wanting more. An important point to note is that in addition to the game having a scene gallery, it can be unlocked in its entirety if you play on the FAP difficulty setting, so you can enjoy the good erotic content right from the start, as soon as you finish the story tutorial. h2Conclusionh2 Personally, I like this game more than Reborn Entertainment's previous release, Love n Life: Lucky Teacher, because despite having a smaller map and fewer mini-games, the gameplay is more entertaining, strategic, and not as repetitive, plus the art is no longer done with AI and looks totally incredible. As for the sexual content, I also think the Live 2D animations are totally awesome, so I would have liked all of them to be of this type, although I suppose that with 15 of these for a price of 7, it's still a good deal. The most notable negative points I see in this game are undoubtedly its generic story and flat heroines. I would have liked them to add others that were less atypical or at least one that had an original story with deeper touches. That said, I have no problem recommending this game because, despite its generic college harem setup, the quality of the sexual content, its socialize gameplay, and its price make it a good buy, especially if you want to have entertaining late-night manual labor sessions. h3bSCORE:b 810 h3 codeb If you liked my review I would appreciate if you give it a thumbs up and follow my curator page so I can recommend more Hentai and 3D adult games.b urlsteamcommunity.comlinkfilter?urlstore.steampowered.comcurator43188760-Hentai-Pixelsh1Hentai Pixelsh1url code",0.0,20000.0,0.0

The new portal is good, I like the gameplay changes. The story is good with strong characters, and is actually quite long. I feel like many of the negative reviews are from people who had made up their mind before the DLC even came out Game so bad they should fire everyone at Bungie including the janitor Very buggy, i mean VERY. From the spinning when u collect matter spark to doors just not opening so you have to replay missions. I love Lodi and the Ikora butt pics but that isnt enough to have me think of this expansion in a positive way. And why is bungie lying ab random shit and changing weird things like the saturation on the director. Like ???. At this moment I would wait for this one to go on sale. Its good. not great. Ich fand die Erweiterung echt gut. Mir gefallen die neuen Mechaniken und die englische Vertonung ist super. Ich mag auch das die Geschichte über mehr verteilte Quests erzählt wird und es gefühlt zumindest auch mehr Geschichte gibt die wirklich wieder spannend ist und auch interessant ist. Es wirkt auch wieder etwas geerdetet als The Final Shape, was ich ebenfalls nicht wirklich schlecht finde. Es ist einfach schön das zu spielen. Kleine Bugs gibt es aber nix schlimmes.
