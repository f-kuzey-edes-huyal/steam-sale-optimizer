266410,iRacing,2015-01-12,3733,84,,,,,"500,000 .. 1,000,000",3844,"I created this account to try iRacing one last time, since I had already tried it for 1 month in my main account. This game is straight up not worth it, you're paying a premium for the illusion of feeling like you're part of an elite cult. h1The positiveh1 iRacing sports an incredible amount of variety when it comes to tracks and cars, no game even comes close to it and likely never will. The cars are beautifully modeled, tons of detail on the interior and exterior of the cars. The setup pages also look believably realistic, with each car sporting very different options for each part you can fine tune. Not many other games go this far with detail, especially on the setup menus. There are always people playing this game, I don't think I've ever seen the online player count be below 10k, regardless of the time. Again, no other game in the same genre gets even close, and probably none will ever. However, this doesn't necessarily mean all races are populated. I'll talk about it in the negative part. Sadly, that's about it. There are many other positive points but they get so heavily overshadowed by the negative part that they will need to be addressed in the next part. Also, there is one big problem with this game that essentially renders all these good things pointless anyways. h1The negativeh1 Even though there's a lot of variety, a lot of series will see a very small attendance number. I think part of this is because many events have a lot of waiting time between races, forcing people who want to race more often to the series that do run more often. Most players will be doing sports car racing, oval and formula run rather similar numbers at a glance. The dirt racing stuff is kind of a wasteland, I'm pretty sure you'll be seeing the same names for a long time if you decide to race those series. Some series run tons of events with only 10 players at most, sometimes there may be a spike at a certain hour but that's the one time during the day that series sees multiple splits. Most people will be doing MX5s or GT3s, but GT3s only run every two hours although enough events cross over for constant racing. I don't know about Oval or Formula, but I'm sure it works the same way but with less people. Most tracks are still missing properly modeled rumble strips, they just play sound and have slightly less grip but that's about it. They don't bump the car up and down, it's very easy to just drive over the curbs without the car really protesting. Granted, even on the tracks with proper collisions on the curbs the cars still behave nice, but the difference is noticeable and you have to be more careful to not make a mistake when driving over them. Trackside objects range from okay to 2008. More recent tracks, or tracks that had been revamped recently, look fine, but there are a lot of tracks that look very dated. At least the driving surface is nice and detailed, but they really look a generation old. The car collisions and general netcode doesn't feel great either. Sometimes the smallest contact gives you tons of damage, sometimes a pretty hard hit does nothing. Their lag compensation stuff is pretty inconsistent, but sadly people don't play with that in mind... Most of my races I've just sandbagged quali and just took the scraps during the race. If you're trying to go through the licenses to unlock the races for the content you purchased, be prepared to avoid racing because it's far too dangerous to go close to other cars. Then of course, the big iRacing tyre debacle. It is as you've heard, these tyres cannot go over the limit without throwing a fit. You have to under drive the car to be on the limit, the tyres will be screeching and screaming but your inputs are like if you're driving grandma to church. It's very counterintuitive, but honestly, once you get the hang of it it's pretty nice. The low speed grip is nice and the cars do feel very darty and planted, a big contrast when compared to many newer sims that have a very sloppy and delayed initial bite to the tyre. But this comes at the cost of the tyres just turning off the moment you press the throttle a bit too hard, or trailbraked a bit too well. It's very easy to tell when you go over the limit, but once you notice that it's almost always too late. To be fair, it's easy enough to stay under the limit, but of course you have to push the limits of the tyres to go fast and the game punishes you very harshly when you go over. Even the updated GT3 tyres have this issue, and this was the main reason I wanted to try iRacing. If this is worlds better than what they had before, I honestly feel bad for whoever was driving GT3s before. The car will just wipe out on you when the tyres are on the colder side and even when up to temp it's very easy to just have the car die on you. The MX5s are absolute hell to drive, these cars are thrashed around the track in real life, but in iRacing you need to drive them with clinical precision. You're still doing 4 wheel slides through the turns, but your inputs really don't match what the car is doing. It's very, very awkward. h1The worst parth1 This would all be acceptable if it wasn't for the insane premium you have to pay. Steam is the cheapest way to get into this game, I bought 1 year of iRacing for 20 euro yes, after tax. I also bought two GT3s because I wanted to have those so I could compare the driving with other games. However, once this subscription is over I'll have to pay 80 euros to renew it, and that is on Black Friday which is the cheapest discount they offer for renewals. But the subscription is just the beginning, then there's a fee of 14 euros per car and 17 per track. The final price will depend on your country or state's VAT, but it won't be too far from that. If you decide to get into a series that doesn't run a lot of free content, you'll be paying around 150 euros to be able to race it. And that will only work for that season which changes every quarter. They'll keep making you buy new tracks if you want to do all the races in your series of choice. There's a discount if you buy stuff on bulk, but it's such a small amount that won't really make a dent unless you're spending thousands on getting all the content in the game. THOUSANDS to have everything in this game, not hundreds. This is how they lock you into their game. You spend thousands on the content, so what's another 200 every 2 years to keep using it. Maybe it's my luck, but this doesn't help with the quality of the racing anyways. You'd think that people who get into this game and pay hundreds every year for the content and the game would take it more seriously and avoid dumb moves, especially with how this game's netcode can be pretty bad. Top split, bottom split, doesn't matter, a lot of people just don't know how to drive and they just ruin everything. Again, this would be fine if it wasn't for the cost. On the topic of the netcode, a lot of people say the price of the subscription is justified since they need to keep the service running, but other games are doing a better job while being a fraction of the price. bThe only thing iRacing simulates properly is the money pit that independently run motorsport is.b IRacing ist einfach eine realistische und super schöne Rennsimulation.

Yine de bazı karakterler yüzeysel kalıyor ve kararların etkisi çoğu zaman beklenenden az hissediliyor.

Gece vakti çatılardan zıplıyorsun, zombiler artık eskisi kadar korkutucu değil. Sesler ve ışıklandırma da eski oyundaki gibi gerilim yaratmıyor. Kısacası, ilk oyundaki o atmosfer bu oyunda eksik kalıyor. Bir de oyun çok hızlı OP olmanı sağlıyor. Yetenek ağacını açıp güçlü silahlar bulunca, zombilerle savaşmak neredeyse çocuk oyuncağı oluyor.

Keşfedilecek alan çok ama çoğu yer, burayı da yapmam lazım gibi hissettiriyor. Yani gerçekten merak edip gittiğin değil, haritada bir ikon gördüğün için uğradığın yerler oluyor.

1144200,Ready or Not,2023-12-13,215460,77,,,,,"5,000,000 .. 10,000,000",587,"Estou aqui para expressar minha decepção com um ótimo jogo como Ready or Not. Extremamente desapontado com a questão da censura. O que tornava ele um ótimo jogo, era sua realidade. Porém, o game se rendeu a industria decepcionando milhares de fãs. Gostaria de solicitar o reembolso, mesmo que não seja possível. Comprei o jogo com uma proposta, e o jogo depois de um tempo tirou isso dos players. Sendo assim, não recomendo mais o game. Estragaram a diversão Ready or Not WAS a game that I would've recommended, had it not been for the latest update. Most of this game is designed to be gritty and disturbing, but not without merit. It's brutal because it's real, and real life is brutal. If SWAT officers are dispatched, it's because there's an issue beat cops couldn't fix. Things like armed gunmen, whether robbery or active shooters in, say, schools or nightclubs, or weaponsdrugshuman smuggling, and there is value in showcasing something that most games, shows or movies wouldn't. Before Ready or Not's full release, Void left their publisher over the level 'Elephant' which showcases an active shooting within a community college. The publisher said it was too much and Void left them to keep that part of the game. It showed integrity on their part, imagine how many copies could've sold with a publisher bankrolling them. But now that full launch is here and Void can stick the game on PS and Xbox, now they're willing to censor. Now they think some things are too graphic. If that integrity they had when they left their publisher is fully gone, as it seems, then maybe Daddy Sony tells Void that the Nightclub Shooting or School Shooting levels are too intense and controversial. I think Void would rather follow that dollar than show that they still believe in what they started. The worst part about all of this is they, Void, started this conversation. Everybody already knows that these horrors happen, but Ready or Not gave you the front row seat. Void said 'there might be some extravagance but for the most part, this is real.' And everyone was engaging with that conversation, but now that the conversation isn't as profitable to them as it was a month ago, they'd seemingly rather stop talking altogether. And it's not like it would be impossible to keep the graphic content. It could be something that's exclusive to PC or it could be a feature that needs to be toggled on or off before playing. But either of those ideas need something to make happen: Money. And if the Devs are willing to censor the conversation they started for a boost in sales, why would they spend a dime to keep the majority of their playerbase as of now happy? Why listen to the feedback of people who already bought your game, There's a new market now! Above everything its just disappointing to see. A developer that WAS willing to push the boundaries of what you could show in a game tasted the sweet milkies from consoles and abandoned their stance. Devs sold out. Made the game worse in many ways in order to accommodate console player addition, and I'm not even talking about the censorship. Visuals are worse, AI is worse overtuned, needlessly added difficulty system and made enemies cracked out and spongey. So much for realism. Update has caused visualgraphical issues. Long loading times. Worse feeling game play. Questionable AI changes. I am not a fan of difficulty options. The enemy NPCs should act based on their character background. Random crack heads or gang members should not have the same inhuman reactions as those with a military backgroundtraining. Haven't played in awhile, but after seeing the update for consoles, I wanted to leave my opinion. Making the game worse just so that it can turn some more profit is awful... It is extremely greedy, to say the least. It saddens me to see the devs have gone this low after such great work.",5000000.0,10000000.0,7071067.811865473

There's little plot, and little variety. The game is unstable, opens up if it wants to, but most of the time doesnt start up and simply freezes your pc Le jeu est juste génial. Je le trouve unique en son genre, les combats au tour par tour sont intéressants, l'ambiance générale musique, graphisme et décors nous plongent dans un univers bien ficelé. Les décors et graphismes sont superbes à mon sens. Les bugs sont peu nombreux et n'altèrent pas l'expérience de jeu. J'ai passé des heures sur ce jeu et c'est de loin l'un de mes préférés. Alors pourquoi je le déconseille ? Wartale est un jeu sorti le 1er décembre 2021 et qui n'est toujours pas terminé depuis cette date. Par contre, de nombreux DLC excellents pour certains et très mauvais pour d'autres sont sorti depuis. Si vous souhaitez acheter la totalité du jeu, il vous en coûtera 107 euros ce qui est beaucoup trop pour le jeu. La stratégie commerciale est la suivante : A sa sortie, vous achetez le jeu, vous le trouvez génial ce qui normal puisqu'il l'est ! , puis SHIRO Game va sortir un paquet de DLC de 12 à 19 euros actuellement qui n'ont pour certains aucun intérêt dans le jeu. L'absence des DLC se fait ressentir pendant l'exploration endroits inaccessibles, et par frustration de ne pouvoir découvrir ces endroits ,vous allez vouloir acheter les DLC en question... A par Belerion et Skelmar, ne les achetez pas, ils n'en valent pas la peine. Les DLC continuent de sortir le prochain est prévu pour septembre 2025 visiblement, mais je ne l'acheterai pas, et le jeu n'est toujours pas terminé. Je me demande même si il sera terminé un jour... Cette stratégie commerciale a déjà été appliquée sur d'autres jeux de SHIRO Game. Et très franchement, c'est prendre les joueurs pour des pigeons. Bref. Le jeu est absolument génial, mais ne l'achetez pas. Wartales is an easy game to get going, but I quickly realized there's alot more nuance. I'm 3 months into my first playthrough, so I'm going to see what happens, but on my next playthrough I've already learned quite a few things I'll do differently. The game has an excellent mechanics, and the combat system allows you to strategize who you engage and when, to attempt to control each battle. Different enemy types force you to adopt different tactics, which is half the fun. I've got 27 hours in so far and it is still engaging and exciting, hopefully it stays that way. The game doesn't give you too much help on completing quests or lead you by the hand, but sometimes it took me a few minutes to figure out what I was supposed to do. It's a nice middle ground between totally frustrating and too easy. The visuals are great, sound is good enough and I've experienced zero bugs, glitches or issues. I wish I had gotten this game sooner, and I can see quite a few more hours in my future! Ich geb dem Spiel auf einer Skala von eins bis zehn eine sieben. Die kämpfe sind gut aber irgendwie zünden sie nicht so richtig. Es währe schöner die Figuren größer zu sehen. Die Labyrinthe machen spaß.

Würde die Welt stimmiger erscheinen lassen. Bin gespannt ob es Konsequenzen hat wenn man einen Unbeliebten Charakter hat.

It has loads of content and is not significantly different from the base game. However, if Elden ring is a 1010 I'd give SOTE an 8.510. First of all, some specific areas do feel a bit more empty than others The Cerulean Coast and Charo's Hidden Grave, as well as the Abyssal Woods. There are also one or two areas in the map that look explore-able upon first glance but aren't accessible, which can throw you off since there aren't any empty spots on the map in the base game. the area south of the Discussion Chamber is empty space and its very misleading. Second of all, the difficulty. This is a plus or minus depending on the person, and while you technically have infinite preparation for any boss, almost every single boss you fight in this game does a massive amount of health whilst you do very little damage in return. Even if you are levelled appropriately, and have the correct amount of Scadutree Blessings, the DLC is noticeably harder than the base game. Third of all, the final boss spoilerConsort Radahnspoiler. This somewhat ties into my second point about the difficulty. The attack patterns of all the bosses in the DLC feel balanced. This is NOT the same for the final boss. It's extremely hard to hit him, the whole fight is basically a test of will. Oops, I got too greedy and died again x20 Dodging his attacks is extremely inconsistent in his second phase due to the uneven ground, so even if you dodge him perfectly it is a hit or miss. His spoilerMiquella'sspoiler hair is extremely long and blocks your screen so you can't see anything he's doing. He's extremely laggy due to all of his unnecessary projectiles. His attacks are un-intuitive and hard to read. If he hits you then you will get staggered into oblivion, you are EXTREMELY punished for getting hit. And finally, the worst part, he's just plain unfun. The devs basically just slap you on the ass like a donkey and say run left because that is his whole strat. If you run right you will die. If you dodge into him you will die. If you dodge away from him you will die. You have to circle left the ENTIRE fight. I can tell the difference between a skill issue and a badly made boss. I beat him after 4-ish hours and I'm good with never fighting him again. Mind you, this is POST nerf and he is still significantly harder to fight than Malenia. spoilerI also wish they created an entirely new boss instead of just bringing back Radahn.spoiler Fourth of all, the cutscene blueballs you. It's a 5 second cutscene and there's nothing particularly special about it. It didn't feel like there was much effort put into the final cutscene at all. As a summary, it's a great DLC. I think people talk smack about the DLC because it's almost impossible to live up to the base game of Elden Ring. Messmer is one of my favorite bosses. The Shadow Keep is incredibly fun to explore. It's beautiful, and an interesting concept. I'll bitch about the final boss but it's literally one boss in the entirety of the DLC which is full of fun and intuitive bosses to fight. If the final boss turns you off from the DLC, buy it anyways and skip him and you won't be missing out on much. Same goes for the empty map. There was a couple areas that were slightly boring to explore, but in the end I still had fun. 剧情一坨狗食啊赶工的痕迹随便8一下到处都是米塔嗯这个东西做出来和狗屎文案根本就是直接侮辱了三个角色的塑造和自尊米凯拉马连尼亚再本体作为根基核心塑造的所有意志与核心就在赶工做不完了模型拉出来重新启用中彻底没了急着圈钱急得都不演了带上那狗日的替换文本滚雷达更是写得像神经病一样 除了大梅还能看 记者圈钱的超级赶工制作剧情拿脚写的是从型月把他妈的狗屎东出请来了吗 빛바랜자 에디션 언제 나오냐 cinematics over fun 1010 best dlc to grace the earth HERMOSO DLC Я сосал меня ебали The DLC is p. good.

3186490,Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate,2025-07-15,1233,47,,,,,"0 .. 20,000",7,"h1 The Edging of our Fate, as they say. h1 After Destiny 2: The Final Shape, most people saw that as the exit they needed after ten years for those who stuck around for that long. h3 The Edge of Fate era, System Changes h3 Edge of Fate, without even buying the expansion brings a massive shift in how you go about your day to day in Destiny 2. There is the portal, bringing an easier method for getting into activities that not only igivei you stuff but igivei you stuff that leads to ifaster progressioni. EoF also brought on the first big reset for anyone who has stuck around in that everyone no matter how long you have played got reset back to 10 Power Basically your level for anyone who hasn't played the game. and changed the power grind to a system that still involves at soft cap but at certain point you are able to over level even above 300 for that season or expansion, and once the next comes you start at that soft cap again. Everyone kept the same armor but ditched old stats! The stat system has been overhauled to the same six different stats, but each providing bonuses up to 100 points and even more points as you go further beyond. Ideally avoiding the i First thing first you need max Resilience i situation all other stats have been given a role. Health is the new resilience, not really providing the same defense until you over level it. Discipline and Melee stay nearly the same but provide damage bonuses pass 100 stat points. Intellect, now called Super provides that even go-go juice from b all sources. b Class is new, but familiar to titans in that your class ability recharges faster and grants you an overshield. Weapons is a new stat that becomes the main focus for PvP enjoyers since Mobility has been depricated. h3 The Fate that was Edged h3 i This is gonna be very rough and tumble so as to not spoil story and is mostly about the campaign gameplay itself. i The campaign is surprisingly heavy on the game time it offers, for very specific reasons. This expansion and the destination that came with it; Bungie claimed would be metroidvania like. Part of those ideas are that throughout the campaign you progressively get more abilities and upgrades to them that allow you to progress the world, open unique Keplar chests, and take the fight to the House of Exile and Choral Vex. b Matterspark b i You can't use a sparrow here! You got dark matter baby! i Matterspark is one of the first abilities you obtain right out of the gate, without much struggle or training montages. Right out of the gate. Matterspark basically turns you in a small orb, allowing you to transverse small vents and the like. You can sort of attack in this form, chaining attacks across enemies for a small amount of damage. You can jump and dash, so when its around going into this form allows for easier transportation in some cases. Upgrading this allows it to do a AoE burst attack, breaking enemy shields amongst other things. You are vulnerable in this form, but can transition out at anytime while you need to find a specific spot to go back into it. b Teleporty Purple Puzzle Gun I forgot the name b Now this is the puzzle part of the Expansion. i let me look up the name of this thing... i The Relocator is a gun you pick up and also upgrade at certain points that allows you to teleport to otherwise walled off usually with Lasers, its often lasers areas that you cannot access. It has chops for clearing enemies as well, working like a void scorch cannon with a little more flair. b Mattermorph b Mattermorph build upon the same tactics of the last two abilities mentioned. It allows you to throw a projectile at highlighted objects in the environment to make them a pathway ahead to a spot to dunk a thing or get to the next thing. Mattermorph also replaces your dedicated melee, turning into a spammable shackle grenade basically, giving you woven mail while also suspending and unraveling your enemies. Very worth abusing in some boss fights. h2 Rushing to a conclusion h2 Having played on legendary right out of the gate and finishing it to completion there, I will say most of the abilities they tried including here feel very hamfisted and did more to kill the momentum of what the story was setting up. Several times, there would be a big moment and I would come into the fight all big shouldered and ready, kill a couple groups of enemies, and then I need to shut down this shield. How do you shut down this shield? Matterspark. Few missions later its the same thing, use matterspark and now the Relocator to get there, and during this boss fight you need to do both to pop its shield so you can keep doing more damage. As you get more abilities and upgrades they ALL are used in every fight. Now while I will say, this something I like as it brings some mechanics into what is supposed to be the bigger storybeats in Destiny 2; the word as I raged through playing on legendary was Tedium. There was a lot of Tedious busy work to do damage on a Boss I know I could beat. Surprisingly did not have a lot of deaths in the campaign during Darkness zones, but once you get to that halfway point the busy work allows for more errors to punish you. During a certain mission towards the end no spoilers you have a timer, and impending doom if you don't get to each of the three objectives on the way back to the boss. Having to figure out what they wanted me to do when I didn't do to specifically get some directions on where I was supposed to go, hearing the story characters on comms being so dramatically scared over comms, and then dead silence as I used matterspark or whichever ability to figure out how to go to the next thing killed the entire momentum of all the epic moments I bknowb they were going for. I may have felt them better on Brave Normal difficulty but I wanted the new exotics, such a sucker. h3 The Closer and Thoughts to my mess of a review h3 The system changes EoF brings are amazing in my opinion and I was more than okay with them. But you don't need to pay money for that. You get all of those changes, free, and on release. The campaign had some banger cutscenes, you get some REALLY good background on old and new characters, and definitely get the idea that this is a start of a new arc. Being such you get a slight cliffhanger as we wait for further progression on the story. But that's what you get the expansion for; a start to the next era of Destiny 2's story. Playing on Legendary, I would say I was ready to be done with the busy work of all the mechanics they added but for some they may be appealing even on Brave difficulty. They brought vaguely Dungeon-Like mechanics with a small hint of Metroidvania. Adjustable World Difficulty post campaign along with that once you finish the campaign is a solid boon too! But I only say they missed the mark because they focus more on what I needed to be doing during the campaign, rather than having me experience it. I will say the story offered at hand and the implications are big. We learn of the omniscient gods i the Nine. i They get more screen time here and speaking of screen time, the cutscenes in this expansion are beautifully done. I would say the best cinematics in the entirety of Destiny 2. Worth the struggle I had getting to the end of the tunnel. 지금 운영을 정확히 똑같이 했었던 게임이 하나 있음. 몹 체력을 겁나 늘리고, 플레이어 스펙은 성장할 수 있지만 저점에서 더 올릴 수 있는 수단은 제한적이고, 그 스펙마저 찔끔찔끔 올라가던 거. 딱 네 개 다른 점이 있다면 여긴 스토리가 끝나도 스펙 올릴 숙제를 해야하고그것도 원래의 배는 넘는 분량, 무기는 특성이 종결이라도 13티어라면 종결 취급을 못해주는 확정 폐지, 방어구는 세트가 있어도 5티어 미만 입을 수 있는 잡템, 모든 장비가 티어 강화가 안됨 심지어 수십만원과 몇천시간을 쏟아부어 얻은 옛날 종결템은 확정적으로 구데기화 하는 짓까지. 이건 절대 라이트한 게임이 아니다. 쓴 돈 아깝다.

Great game, very caring developers, diverse trucks and trailers, huuge world, and the attention to detail is amazing Sadly though i do not have the hardware requirements to play it anymore, but when I upgrade my hardware i'll pick it right up. Still, that doesnt mean it's a bad game dsadsaads Niccuhhh ts fiar like airforce civic lugnut Relaxing, long drives throughout most of Europe, if you have all the DLCs, and they're definitely worth the extra money. I've been playing this game nonstop since I bought it, and it truly is a gem. Not all roads are exactly the same, some might be under construction, some might have wrecks, some might have cars that were pulled over, etc... The AI isn't perfect either, and I'm not saying that in a bad way. Quite the opposite. The AI vehicles sometimes make mistakes, just like humans. The massive map is also very detailed, foliage looks real, cities look alive, there's fog in the morning, this games truly has some of the most realistic map designs I've ever seen. This section is me complaining to devs, so if you're a gamer, skip this paragraph The one and ONLY critique of this game is the fact that they never released The Heart of Russia DLC. I'm a sucker for Eastern European architecture, and we got a little bit of Russia in the Baltics DLC. I'm definitely not saying I support the war, but releasing the DLC wouldn't necessarily support Russia. Maybe a more ideal approach would be, well if the war doesn't end soon, create a Ukraine DLC, release it, then finish the Russian one and release it as well. That would make the studio remain neutral, and plus, the studio would also be getting the best of both worlds. If you publicly condemn one side, then people from that side would most likely not want to buy your game. But that's just my idea. This game is also super fun when paired with something else. For example, I listen to audio books when I'm on the road. Podcasts or songs would also be very entertaining. This is, overall, the best driving simulator I've ever played.

I like this game SO much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yes Cities: Skylines 장점 높은 자유도 도시를 마음대로 설계할 수 있어서 창의력을 발휘하기 좋아. 도로, 전기, 물, 쓰레기, 세금까지 전부 직접 관리할 수 있다. 뛰어난 현실성 교통 체증, 공해, 실업률 같은 문제들이 실제 도시처럼 발생해서 현실감이 있다. 그냥 건물만 짓는 게임이 아니다. 모드Mod의 중요성 유저들이 만든 모드를 설치하면 건물이나 시스템을 무한히 추가할 수 있으며, 모드가 제일 중요하다. DLC의 다양성 날씨, 교통, 자연재해, 공공 정책 같은 걸 추가해주는 확장팩이 많아서 질릴 틈이 없다. 단점 높은 진입장벽 설명이 부족해서 처음 하는 사람은 뭘 해야 할지 모를 수 있다. 그렇기에 초반엔 도시가 망하는 게 순식간이다. 컴퓨터 사양 문제 도시가 커지면 프레임이 떨어지고 로딩도 길어져. 특히 모드 많이 쓰면 더 심하다. UIUX의 불편함 정보 찾기가 힘들고, 창이 많아서 관리하기 귀찮을 때가 있다. 총평 Cities: Skylines는 도시 건설 게임 중에서도 완성도가 정말 높은 게임이며, 전략적으로 도시를 키우는 재미가 있어서 시간 가는 줄 모른다. 다만 초보자라면 유튜브나 공략을 좀 참고하는 게 좋다. 평점: 4.55",10000000.0,20000000.0,14142135.623730922

The game is beautiful to look at, the combat is great and it is priced between free and 9.99, so at a very base level, it's really a good buy. However, to really get a decent functional experience, expect to pay an additional 200 minimum. If you get sucked into competitive progression or have little self-control, the price is pretty much limitless. The game has tons of inconvenience by design with pay for convenience solutions. Also, it is a case study in manipulative micro transactions. If you are hyper vigilant about avoiding unnecessarymanipulative micro transactions and give up any aspiration of competitive progression you can get years of great escapist fun out of the game for a reasonable price. The gameplay and world building are super frustrating because with a bit more care, they could have one of the largest and deepest fantasy realms to lose yourself in. After having tried for years to make sense out of the goddawful gibberish the NPCs babble, it's just not worth it. Trying to read the text questunderstand the story will cause literal physical pain.

But there are some bstuffb I really miss in this game and I hope that the devs will take care of it and add some of this into the game over the time. list Double beds have a bug where your partner has to log out and can't sleep in them in the prefab houses Driving vehicles is really clunky and would need an optimization Building fences without a guide that tells you how ofteh you have to rotate is a real pain, would be cool if that changes This game needs way more building structures like: Let us build brick or stone houses, more roof parts, way more decoration you can use, more house structures in general, real glass windows, chairs you can use More food variety, maybe sausage with seasonings, steaks, grounded beef etc Give us a list that shows how many animals we have, it's really annoying counting all your chickens over the time Friends who logged out should respawn at the place they logged out, not on the bus station Maybe some terraforming? I would love a pond with ducks etc and the game really needs the option to build gravel paths or something like this Decorative trees, bushes, fruit trees etc would be awesome Maybe a more lively city with NPCs walking around, the current NPCs who give quests or work in the shops just sitting there and doing nothing. Some other ranchers who you can sell stuff would be awesome and give the world more life. list But don't let you bdistractb from this list, the game still is fun with friends or alone If you prefer it this way. It has some really nice things and features already and it seems like the devs still work on this game with their broadmap updatesb, but still this game needs some more love, fixes and quality of life updates. It's worth the price, you can spend a lot of hours with this game, enjoy the ranchers life and have fun with it. A chill, satisfying sandbox where you build your dream ranch from the ground up. Whether you're raising chickens, hunting deer, or hauling lumber with friends, its surprisingly fun and addictive. Great in co-op, with plenty of room to grow.

Fantastic addon, that is so ingrained into how I play it feels native now. Great addition to a great game Thought I'd give my thoughts on each DLC now cuz why not. Royalty adds some fairly interesting systems, but at the time, I personally feel like it is the most avoidable gameplay of all the DLCs so far. Not to say that Royalty is bad, or doesn't have content, but most of it is 100 avoidable without even trying, minus the mech clusters. But what it basically adds is the following : - Psycasting, which essentially gives your pawns some magical powers. While I do like psycasting, I find it isn't always good. Really depends what psycasts you got for your pawn, some of them are not very useful in my personnal opinion. The other DLCs added more useful features, but it does synergise well with said DLCs however. - Royal titles, which gives you a Dwarf Fortress-esque nobility system, where the higher the rank, the more annoying the pawn becomes. It is interesting, but can be a pain depending on where you decided to make your base. - Mechanoid Clusters will now become a threat you have to deal with. Essentially, it is the Mechanoid's version of a siege. It does however bring a fairly big list of prostetics which can really enhance your pawns, and... Again... Synergises really well with the rest of the game and DLCs. And also the OST kicks ass. Still a DLC I'd recommand, but I'd say it isn't the most important one by itself.",0.0,20000.0,0.0

Highly recommend getting into it blind. superbe expérience q wea ma wena 1010 Much like the game's central theme of rehabilitation and rebellion, I was held prisoner of this story for the past five to six weeks, from which I finally broke free last night. I must be clear about something, I am a SMT veteran who never played a persona game before and I was not exactly thrilled by the social sim aspect of these games, so I walked in expecting absolutely nothing. despite that fact, I came through completely rehabilitated by this game. There's just.. something marvelous and undescribable about how this story presents itself and develops, even though all your characters follow your stereotypical tropes you still fall in love with and want to spend time with them, even in the most trivial and boring moments you actually have fun interacting with them. You actually spend so much time building your relationships with the cast that you want to see them succeed. The same can be said about most of the villains, most are well written and make themselves hated by the player through their exposition. As an RPG fan I was looking forward to the dungeons and progression systems in this game, however they are rather simple, the combat is pretty much the same exploit weakness to get extra turn from the SMT series, which can be pretty cheeseable when you understand it. On the other hand, dungeons are few but well constructed, exactly what I expected from Atlus, nothing magnificent but mostly serviceable aside from the spaceport, uck that dungeon. There's also mementos, the farm dungeon where you go to grind levels and do sidequests, this was by far the weakest part of the game since the dungeon itself is procedurally generated, bland and ugly to look at. However it serves its purpose well. The story starts pretty weird but quickly becomes incredible, when all pieces start coming into place and you can finally see the full picture the DLC campaing kicks in you have to fulfill a very specific condition to even trigger this campaign, condition that was not exactly well telegraphed in-game, breaking the pace for a bit before wrapping the story up quite masterfully. This game goes beyond the recommendation, this is one of those games you have to experience for yourself, HOWEVER.. there's a catch. Persona 5R is rather lenghty, if you are a working adult with little time to play like mysef I think it'll be hard for you to enjoy the game properly, since the game is not only long, but demands lenghty play sessions to actually make some progress. Therefore, I can only recommend this game if you have a month or so to spare.

1627720,Lies of P,2023-09-18,44925,91,,,,,"1,000,000 .. 2,000,000",673,"very fun game. really, very fum game I played the demo back in 2023 subsequently the full game on release day on my trusty PS4. I picked it up on my PC after the release of Overture DLC to go through it again. It really is a special game. Amazing story characters, weapon animations that rival sometimes even surpass those seen in FromSoftware's portfolio. h2 Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness. h2 While the game clearly borrows heavily from FromSoftwares formula, it truly comes into its own when introducing original ideas. The Legion Armsespecially after the DLCare a joy to experiment with. Other standout mechanics include the vinyl record collectibles and the record player in the hub, as well as the POrgan upgrade system, which adds depth to character progression. However, the level design is where the game falters. Environments often feel bland and uninspired, turning exploration into a monotonous trek from one boss to the next with only occasional side paths. During my first playthrough, I overlooked this, still holding out hope for variety. But on repeat runs, the lack of engaging design becomes painfully apparent. Side quests suffer from similar shortcomings. Rather than encouraging organic discovery, the game relies on star-gazer icons or Geminis voice lines to nudge players toward objectives. This handholding undermines immersion and feels disengagingsimilar to how Atreus or Mimir in the newer God of War games frequently spell out puzzle solutions, robbing players of the chance to think for themselves. Another thing that stood out during my second playthrough is how much easier the bosses felt. Enemies that once seemed nearly impossible at launch now fall quickly, even on Legendary Stalker difficulty. Maybe Ive improved, but its been two years since I last playedand that was only a single run. Continuing on that thread, the new audio log feature introduced in the DLC is another misstep. It takes control away from the player, forcing you to sit through two-minute recordings without the option to interact or skip. And finally, Ill admit that one issue may be partly on me: running the game on a Linux machine causes it to crash about every 20 minutes. The only reliable fix Ive found is launching it with the -dx11 argument to force DirectX 11. h2 With all that said.. h2 I love this game, I love this game with all its flaws. I love the characters, I love the plot, I love the small bite-sized stories in the side quests, I love the beautiful vinyl soundtracks, I love the combat, I love the weapons, I love the bosses. It is refreshing to see someone other than FromSoftware take a swing at this formula. I hope the devs see this note from a passionate fan and keep it in mind while developing the sequel. Very good and quite similar to Bloodborne Most interesting souls-like game I've ever touched outside of FromSoftware. The combat is incredibly difficult with parry timings rivaling of Sekiro. Music and atmosphere is also 1010.

1651560,Fabledom,2024-05-13,5694,86,"Casual, Simulation, Strategy",Casual;Simulation;Strategy,$20.99,$10.49 USD,"200,000 .. 500,000",435,"I really liked the idea of the game, from the videos I started playing, first tutorial mode, I screwed up the city layout, I wasn't far in, so I restarted the game Got to building and planning out the village to prepare for a town, only to realize I cannot upgrade the houses and even though I have 3 Grannerys for food storage and 5 Farms, 3 Fisherys, 2 Bakerys etc...I have not yet got to common people because the house upgrades are expensive. Yet despite my 500 Surplus of food, my villagers are starving and thus making themselves unhappy. Why? Every 14 Villager is a Useless Head of Household, these guys should be keeping the food stocked, I have food all over my Small Town, yet half my village is starving. Despite having all of the vegetables, fish, bread Haven't unlocked meat yet I really do like the fablefairy tale portion of it from what little i've seen. Found a glass slipper and a talking tree, declined the beanstalk because we needed food and tried to court Sir Payne. The other problem is my villagers are just too slow, even if I set priority on a building they will get around to it at least 3 days later sometimes, instead of dropping everything and all grabbing or bringing the resources to that spot, they'll continue with their own job and then come around to it later, which tends to fail quests, even if I have all the resources to make the building. I really like the idea behind it, just needs a bit of refining yes 哈哈買錯了 但蠻好玩的 Fabledom is a city-building simulation game that takes a refreshing and whimsical approach to a well-worn genre. Developed by Grenaa Games, it trades the gritty realism and micromanagement-heavy focus of many modern city builders for a lighter, more fairy tale-inspired tone. With its charming visuals, accessible mechanics, and romantic storytelling elements, Fabledom offers a cozy, engaging experience that invites players to create and govern a fantastical kingdom full of adorable citizens, mythical creatures, and diplomatic intrigue. Its a game that values personality and playfulness as much as it does strategic depth. The basic premise of Fabledom is familiar: start with a small plot of land, gather resources, build structures, and grow your settlement into a flourishing kingdom. However, the execution is where the game distinguishes itself. Everything from the UI to the art design exudes warmth and charm, featuring a storybook aesthetic with lush green fields, cartoonish buildings, and animated villagers that feel alive and expressive. The atmosphere is relaxing without being dull, with enough layers of challenge and variety to keep even experienced players invested. Instead of industrial growth or military conquest, the focus is on well-being, aesthetics, and the relationships between your citizens and neighbors. A standout feature is the way Fabledom introduces narrative and character into city building. You arent just developing infrastructureyoure crafting a living story. One of the more unique aspects is the inclusion of royal suitors from neighboring kingdoms, each with distinct personalities and diplomatic consequences. Courting one of them becomes a narrative thread that weaves into your overall strategy, impacting trade, alliances, and even the aesthetics of your city depending on the traits of the ruler you pursue. This romantic and political system adds a layer of personal investment to what might otherwise be a mechanical process of expansion. In terms of mechanics, Fabledom strikes a balance between accessibility and depth. Resource management is streamlined without being overly simplistic. Players must still balance food, housing, happiness, and labor, but the pace is forgiving and rarely punishing. Construction and planning feel intuitive, and the game introduces new mechanics gradually, allowing players to learn organically as their kingdom grows. Whether it's introducing farms, bakeries, marketplaces, or defense structures, progression feels steady and rewarding. There's also a degree of customization that allows players to shape their cities according to personal preference, adding creative flair to efficiency. The game also features light combat and defense systems, but theyre secondary to the main city-building focus. Goblin invasions and wild beasts may threaten your citizens, but the tone remains playful rather than dire. Military structures and hero units can be built to protect your town, and these moments of tension serve to break up the peaceful flow without drastically shifting the games tone. This makes Fabledom ideal for players who want just a touch of action without the stress of full-scale warfare or tactical micromanagement. Visually and aurally, Fabledom is a delight. The colorful, painterly aesthetic is inviting, and animations are smooth and expressive, giving life to every structure and citizen. The soundtrack supports the fairy tale setting with gentle melodies and ambient sounds that create a soothing, immersive environment. From birds chirping in the morning to the bustle of villagers in town squares, the audio design helps make your kingdom feel like a living, breathing world. If there's a drawback to Fabledom, its that players seeking high complexity or realism might find it too lighthearted or straightforward. Theres less emphasis on granular economic simulation or large-scale challenges, and long-term replayability could hinge on post-launch content or expansions. Some systems, such as diplomacy or logistics, feel underdeveloped compared to more traditional city builders. However, the game is still evolving through updates, and the developer has shown a strong commitment to community feedback and continual improvement. Overall, Fabledom is a beautifully crafted and heartwarming city builder that succeeds by doing something different. It prioritizes charm, storytelling, and accessibility without sacrificing the core satisfaction of growing and managing a vibrant town. For players who enjoy cozy games with a strong sense of personality and a light touch of strategy, Fabledom offers a delightful escape into a magical world where kindness, creativity, and connection matter just as much as productivity.

Parece uma história em quadrinhos moderna. Recomendo se você gosta de uma boa história e personagens cativantes. Há um mod que traduz o jogo que está muito bom. One of the best games I've ever played and it has a special place in my heart. Highly recommend getting into it blind. superbe expérience q wea ma wena 1010 Much like the game's central theme of rehabilitation and rebellion, I was held prisoner of this story for the past five to six weeks, from which I finally broke free last night. I must be clear about something, I am a SMT veteran who never played a persona game before and I was not exactly thrilled by the social sim aspect of these games, so I walked in expecting absolutely nothing. despite that fact, I came through completely rehabilitated by this game. There's just.. something marvelous and undescribable about how this story presents itself and develops, even though all your characters follow your stereotypical tropes you still fall in love with and want to spend time with them, even in the most trivial and boring moments you actually have fun interacting with them. You actually spend so much time building your relationships with the cast that you want to see them succeed. The same can be said about most of the villains, most are well written and make themselves hated by the player through their exposition. As an RPG fan I was looking forward to the dungeons and progression systems in this game, however they are rather simple, the combat is pretty much the same exploit weakness to get extra turn from the SMT series, which can be pretty cheeseable when you understand it. On the other hand, dungeons are few but well constructed, exactly what I expected from Atlus, nothing magnificent but mostly serviceable aside from the spaceport, uck that dungeon. There's also mementos, the farm dungeon where you go to grind levels and do sidequests, this was by far the weakest part of the game since the dungeon itself is procedurally generated, bland and ugly to look at. However it serves its purpose well. The story starts pretty weird but quickly becomes incredible, when all pieces start coming into place and you can finally see the full picture the DLC campaing kicks in you have to fulfill a very specific condition to even trigger this campaign, condition that was not exactly well telegraphed in-game, breaking the pace for a bit before wrapping the story up quite masterfully. This game goes beyond the recommendation, this is one of those games you have to experience for yourself, HOWEVER.. there's a catch. Persona 5R is rather lenghty, if you are a working adult with little time to play like mysef I think it'll be hard for you to enjoy the game properly, since the game is not only long, but demands lenghty play sessions to actually make some progress. Therefore, I can only recommend this game if you have a month or so to spare. TL;DR: Wonderful game flipped my view on the social sim aspect, classic atlus experience gamewise, lovable characters, great story with some pacing issues towards the end. ACTUALLY CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO WORKING ADULTS WITH LITTLE PLAYTIME. I played the game a lot on Playstation. Bought it on PC for modding. This is still one of the best games of all time. h2this game is peakh2 People say this game is peak, and their right, go into playing this game with no knowledge and it will change your life, promise -The story is one of the best in all of video games, this game will have you questioning your life and the thing you can do at 11PM -The soundtrack is the best of the best, able to capture the feeling of the game in all of its aspects, one of the best parts -The art is so nice, you'll never get sick of looking at it -the Characters are very VERY well written and on top of that they are also voice acted which is a nice touch over all 1010 spoilerPancakesspoiler ...........................................",2000000.0,5000000.0,3162277.6601683795

Even Battlefront puts this to shame. Server owners get limited to 16 slots when it should be 32 or 64 slots.

2778580,ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree,2024-06-20,81025,71,,,,,"0 .. 20,000",397,"くそ強いボス戦遺灰使いたいのに使う前に攻撃される避けて使おうとしても間髪入れずに次の攻撃がやってくるからいつまでも遺灰出せない出すならダメージ食らう前提じゃないと使えない意味がわかんないそこまで上手じゃない人でも遊べるように遺灰使わせるくらい余裕持たせるべきじゃないのじゃあそんな不満言うならソウルライク遊ぶなよって声が出てきそうだけどうんもうやめるわめんどくさ 미켈라단 애미 Before speaking on anything else, I think theres way too much hate for this DLC. It has loads of content and is not significantly different from the base game. However, if Elden ring is a 1010 I'd give SOTE an 8.510. First of all, some specific areas do feel a bit more empty than others The Cerulean Coast and Charo's Hidden Grave, as well as the Abyssal Woods. There are also one or two areas in the map that look explore-able upon first glance but aren't accessible, which can throw you off since there aren't any empty spots on the map in the base game. the area south of the Discussion Chamber is empty space and its very misleading. Second of all, the difficulty. This is a plus or minus depending on the person, and while you technically have infinite preparation for any boss, almost every single boss you fight in this game does a massive amount of health whilst you do very little damage in return. Even if you are levelled appropriately, and have the correct amount of Scadutree Blessings, the DLC is noticeably harder than the base game. Third of all, the final boss spoilerConsort Radahnspoiler. This somewhat ties into my second point about the difficulty. The attack patterns of all the bosses in the DLC feel balanced. This is NOT the same for the final boss. It's extremely hard to hit him, the whole fight is basically a test of will. Oops, I got too greedy and died again x20 Dodging his attacks is extremely inconsistent in his second phase due to the uneven ground, so even if you dodge him perfectly it is a hit or miss. His spoilerMiquella'sspoiler hair is extremely long and blocks your screen so you can't see anything he's doing. He's extremely laggy due to all of his unnecessary projectiles. His attacks are un-intuitive and hard to read. If he hits you then you will get staggered into oblivion, you are EXTREMELY punished for getting hit. And finally, the worst part, he's just plain unfun. The devs basically just slap you on the ass like a donkey and say run left because that is his whole strat. If you run right you will die. If you dodge into him you will die. If you dodge away from him you will die. You have to circle left the ENTIRE fight. I can tell the difference between a skill issue and a badly made boss. I beat him after 4-ish hours and I'm good with never fighting him again. Mind you, this is POST nerf and he is still significantly harder to fight than Malenia. spoilerI also wish they created an entirely new boss instead of just bringing back Radahn.spoiler Fourth of all, the cutscene blueballs you. It's a 5 second cutscene and there's nothing particularly special about it. It didn't feel like there was much effort put into the final cutscene at all. As a summary, it's a great DLC. I think people talk smack about the DLC because it's almost impossible to live up to the base game of Elden Ring. Messmer is one of my favorite bosses. The Shadow Keep is incredibly fun to explore. It's beautiful, and an interesting concept. I'll bitch about the final boss but it's literally one boss in the entirety of the DLC which is full of fun and intuitive bosses to fight. If the final boss turns you off from the DLC, buy it anyways and skip him and you won't be missing out on much. Same goes for the empty map. There was a couple areas that were slightly boring to explore, but in the end I still had fun. 剧情一坨狗食啊赶工的痕迹随便8一下到处都是米塔嗯这个东西做出来和狗屎文案根本就是直接侮辱了三个角色的塑造和自尊米凯拉马连尼亚再本体作为根基核心塑造的所有意志与核心就在赶工做不完了模型拉出来重新启用中彻底没了急着圈钱急得都不演了带上那狗日的替换文本滚雷达更是写得像神经病一样 除了大梅还能看 记者圈钱的超级赶工制作剧情拿脚写的是从型月把他妈的狗屎东出请来了吗 빛바랜자 에디션 언제 나오냐 cinematics over fun 1010 best dlc to grace the earth HERMOSO DLC Я сосал меня ебали The DLC is p. good.

Love the artwork, the music, and how it's a great combination of being a chill game that leads to some occasional nail-biting moments. Well worth the price. He is Coming is one of the most entertaining and engaging games I've played in a while.

This can't happen in my first run of the day and for the 20th time. no useful items and monsters just whittled me away. I don't recommend this game as it stands. Edited 71925 This game is more on the neutral side. Compared to great roguelites like STS and Brotato, this game is just average. The game is addictive for not the best of reasons. There are a lot of delayed variable rewards, and seeminly lots to explore but it becomes obvious your adventuring is less impactful to your success than you might think. The item management is strict, and you have to make a build quickly and specifically to win certain fights. It is why some people love Balatro and some people hate it. So much of your success depends on rolling one-two good items, and the rest is history. Then everything else becomes very meaningless. Even finding rare events or defeating elite bosses happen so late in the run, that if you are already losing, chances are it won't affect your ability to complete a run. In terms of addictiveness, I find it similar to Heretic's Fork. It is very RNG heavy and that can be fun at first, but the novelty of it falls off, and when it does, it falls off hard. With STS, and brotato, there are many lines you can take that leads to many outcomes, all with its own decision branches. Each run you lose, you can figure out what you should have done or you've learned something. There are many variables that can affect your run, all of which you have agency over. Yes that happens in this game too, you learn to build something to defeat the first boss. You learn some optimal pathing. You learn what risks to take. But then it immediately stops there. and each and every loss after that becomes RNG. and you ask yourself, what you were meant to do in that situation. and when I say immediately, it can happen from anywhere to 2 hours or 20 hours of playing. there is just so little options in terms of event variety, in terms of pathing, in terms of what resources you can manage. So if that 10 is worth it to you, by all means get this game. I certainly had tons of fun with it and I will be playing it a few more hours. But I'm not sure how much longer this game can hold me. The other glaring issue and perhaps this is PTSD from rogue tower is, you will unlock items, and it will make your runs even harder. This might be an echo chamber of what others have said about this game, but that feels like a very basic game design issue that needs to be addressed. I'm not saying I want meta progression, but from a design point, it just doesn't make sense. and some of the items unlocked are utterly useless.",0.0,20000.0,0.0

Steam rolled out a sneaky unpacking scheme change on July 10th. This change affected many games recent updates, including RimWorld Odyssey, which released the 1.6 variant soon after. Ultimately, this made Odyssey and users attempting to update to 1.6 impossible if they are running Steam on an older operating system that is no longer supported Windows 7, 8, 10. The only solution I can find is that you must select the beta 1.5 patch of RimWorld prior to a clean install, and disable this expansion in order to successfully install. Otherwise, the download will hang in corrupt filecontent unavailable forever. Unfortunately, at this time, there is no work around for players using older operating systems. Steam will continue to steam roll over their legacy code until our products are no longer playable despite us having paid for them. Please support Ross and the STOP KILLING GAMES initiative, in order to take action to protect our games from publishers that want to destroy our means of playing them. More than any other expansion, you can never go back after experiencing this playstyle. Even if I wanted to do a static base again, I would start out with a gravship, just with no mech hive chase. Why, because it fixes the worst part of Rimworld imo, and that's early game component headaches. If you need more components, you can just go and look for more, no more having to caravan and cross your fingers everything falls apart while your early game group is split. In place of components, you progression is now measured by gravpanels and the space allowance of your ship which is infinitely more interesting and enjoyable because you can work with those limitations creatively to find solutions. Compared to components as a roadblock which is way more binary and boring. Adds so much to the game, my favorite DLC so far Rimworld DLC's are usually good, but this one takes the cake",0.0,20000.0,0.0

If you buy it, there's a 5050 chance you'll be able to play it or not!!! прокурор завел дело на кота по кличке Mr. Penis за то, что тот скинул со стола и разбил любимую кружку хозяйки. как позже выяснилось, кот был рекордсменом по прыжкам и скорости бега, но имел ожирение, а также был замечен ранее в том, что продырявил джинсы. Позже доктор подтвердил, что этот кот просто ужас, поставив ему диагноз полного распиздяя. Адвокат же начал приводить аргументы, что наша хозяйка является шизофреничкой, которая прошла сво, получила птср, и теперь у нее дома лежит штурмовая винтовка АК-47. По версии адвоката и свидетеля-полицейского это хозяйка разбила свою же кружку во время припадка, а затем обвинила в этом кота, которого позже повязал и привез в суд тот самый полицейский. Еще в квартире хозяйки был найден кальян, а также ее кровь на разбитой кружке, что также подтверждает версию о том, что это она разбила кружку. Под конец заседания прокурор привел улику, что у кота были найдены окровавленные сюрикены, что намекало на то, что Мистер Пинус является вовсе необычным котом. Теперь сложилась версия, что кот разбил кружку, но чтобы уж точно его не посадили, он поранил хозяйку сюрикенами и пролил кровь на кружку, чтобы суд обвинил хозяйку в клевете и освободил кота. 16.07.2025 Мистер Пенис по решению суда был отправлен в кошачий приют за все свои деяния.

Sanki 2-3 günde düzenlenen bir oyun geliştirme etkinliğinde hazırlanmış, sadece fikir olarak sunulan ama üzerinde çalışılmamış bir taslak gibi. Hatta bana sorarsanız, o seviyede bile değil. Sadece para kazanmak için erkenden piyasaya sürülmüş gibi duruyor. Feedback toplamak için erken erişime açtılar diyenlere de hatırlatmak isterim: Oyunların alfa ve beta test süreçleri vardır zaten. Bu oyun, erken erişim için bile hazır değil. Ben erken erişimde de olsa güzel bir tasarıma sahip yeni bir life skill odaklı oyun oynarım, en kötü ihtimalle 100 saatimi alır diye düşündüm. Bu arada New World, RuneScape, BDO gibi oyunlarda yüzlerce saat life skill yapmış biri olarak 100 saatlik eğlenceli bir deneyim gerçekten düşük bir beklenti. Ve bu oyun onu bile karşılayamadı.
