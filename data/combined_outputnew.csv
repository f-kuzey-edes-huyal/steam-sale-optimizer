But i do like the challenge and how easy it is to learn to play. Newer patches from the dev disrespecting and intentiolly shitting in the playerbase's mouth. I dont want to fckin drink smoothie and hide in a junkyard cabin from the storm for 10minutes, then waiting at night for another 20. I want npc-s, old zombie horde system, brainless hordes that are numerous as in Project Zomboid The new system where you made zombies a engineer degree master phd student is fcuked up. Its predictable. You can shoot in a fckin metropolis and noone give a fuck, there is no point of using melee in lategame cuz there are two grannies that shamble toward you after you explode the dishong tower. The longevity and success of 7 Days to Die can be largely attributed to its modability and strong community engagement. One of the games greatest strengths has always been its sandbox survival experience, where players are given the freedom to adapt and build anywhere. However, recent updates introducing badges or restrictions on building near trader areas represent a shift away from that core survival ethos. While perhaps intended to balance gameplay or encourage exploration, they can feel limitingespecially for players who enjoy establishing bases near traders as part of their strategic planning. The freedom to build and survive on one's own terms is a hallmark of the experience that should be preserved. Moreover, it's evident that the modding community consistently produces innovative and high-quality content, often at a faster pace than official development cycles. From overhaul mods like Darkness Falls and Undead Legacy to minor quality-of-life tweaks, these community contributions have filled gaps and kept the game fresh for years. Integrating official support for the Steam Workshop would be a major step forward, empowering creators and making it easier for players to discover and install mods seamlessly. Its a feature many players have requested, and its addition would elevate the games accessibility and replay value. While recent updates have introduced small but welcome quality-of-life improvements, such as UI tweaks, smoother animations, and stability fixes, some of these changes feel incremental. Players who have followed the games long development cycle may feel that more substantial content additions are overdue. That said, the developers have done commendable work over the years expanding the game. From a content perspective, 7 Days to Die has evolved dramaticallyfrom its early alpha builds to its current state. The inclusion of new POIs Points of Interest, biomes, complex zombie AI, electricity systems, and the addition of dynamic weather and water systems have made the world feel more immersive and challenging. Continued improvements to weapon variety, armor customization, and vehicle mechanics have also added depth to combat and mobility. Going forward, many in the community would love to see: Expanded weapon and armor systems with modular upgrades and unique effects More diverse vehicle options with customization capabilities Base-building improvements including new block shapes, defensive traps, and AI behavior Official modding tools and Steam Workshop support for streamlined access Optional toggles to preserve the open-ended survival feel for solo and private servers In conclusion, 7 Days to Die remains one of the most versatile and replayable survival games available today. By embracing its modding roots and refining both player freedom and official content updates, the game has the potential to reach true top-tier status in its genre. no 好玩配置好的话会体验更好",10000000.0,20000000.0,14142135.623730922

As both a historical epic and a character-driven journey, Origins excels on multiple levels. You play as Bayek of Siwa, a Medjay whose personal tragedy sets him on a path of vengeance, justice, and ultimately, transformation. His character is compelling, emotionally layered, and well-voiced, making him one of the most memorable protagonists in the series. Visually, Origins is stunning. From the golden sands of the desert to the bustling streets of Alexandria, Ubisoft's recreation of Ptolemaic Egypt is immersive and awe-inspiring. Every ruin, statue, and hieroglyph feels authentic, inviting exploration and rewarding curiosity. The day-night cycle and dynamic weather further enhance the realism and beauty of the world. Gameplay-wise, Origins introduces an overhauled combat system, trading in the old counter-attack mechanics for a more fluid and challenging action-RPG approach. It may take some getting used to, but the change adds depth and satisfaction to every encounter. The inclusion of loot, gear upgrades, and skill trees adds customization and strategy that was lacking in previous entries. The story is rich with political intrigue, emotional moments, and mythology, all while setting the foundation for the Assassin Brotherhood. The side quests are meaningful and diverse, often telling unique stories that deepen the world and its characters. The game also features the incredible Discovery Tour mode, which lets you explore ancient Egypt as a living museuman excellent educational tool and a peaceful, beautiful way to appreciate the games artistry and research. Verdict: Assassins Creed Origins is more than just a return to formit's a rebirth. With its captivating world, emotionally grounded protagonist, and engaging gameplay, it not only revitalizes the franchise but sets a new standard for historical open-world games. A must-play for fans of the series and newcomers alike.",1000000.0,2000000.0,1414213.5623730957

Standing on the shoulders of some mighty titans of gaming, such as Castlevania and Metroid among others, Dead Cells feels like the spiritual successor of those classic games. The visuals are fluid and crisp while maintaining their retro style, and the gameplay is tighter than my eccentric uncle Alexander, who slips his finger into the coin return of every vending machine he comes across, in hopes of finding that rare, abandoned quarter. What I'm saying is that he's a tightwad, and this game is awesome. Cursed, die, cry, repeat Помню, как ещё в девятом классе эта игра вгрызлась мне в душу своей уникальной атмосферой, богатым арсеналом, тонкими отсылками и незабываемыми саундтреками, которые до сих пор звучат в голове. В этом мире каждая позорная смерть становилась уроком не сдаваться и идти дальше, несмотря на поражения. Однозначно рекомендую всем, кто любит рогалики и метроидвании great game. I like to think of Dead Cells as Dark Souls Hollow Knight. Two of my favorite games, combined together into my favorite genre of roguelikes. This game is beautifully crafted with its elegant pixel art and fast-paced combat. You're always on your toes, as you can get extra rewards for going through a stage without being hit. You can build your Beheaded however you want, with the hundreds of items and affinities. No two runs are the same, as you can go through different paths through the plethora of stages Dead Cells offers.

I have supported destiny for years. I have preordered almost every single expansion since beyond light, and have been an active player for years. However, with the new expansion I only played for 4 hours before I had to throw in the towel and I now have so many complaints. 1: All of my past builds are worthless. Thanks to the new armor system my builds that were above par, are now well subpar. I move slower then a snail in molasses. 2: Theres no new subclass, no new abilities. For an expansion, id expect SOMETHING new to be added. Theres nothing here. Before I get someone to try and defend the game let me breakdown my perspective: Beyond Light: Stasis Witch queen: Weapon crafting Lightfall: Strand Final Shape: Prismatic Edge of fate: ??? Theres nothing here. Why am I expected to pay 100 for a 30 expansion. 3: The fact I have to regrind my armor EVERY 6 MONTHS!? Yeah forget it. Its been fun guardians, but I'm done. I want my money back, I'm hanging up my cloak. THIS EXPANSION SUCKS. STORY SUCKS. GAMEPLAY SUCKS. NOTHING NEW. this has literally got to be the worst expansion yet to this lame ass game. The whole campaign is just running from way point to way point with dialogue over comms. No in game cinematic events, no cool interactions. Just go turn on these generators while running around this area 3 times to get a new power to move some shit out your way, then the boss? Oh just a bigger Shank with a wire rifle strapped to its head. Wheres the passion? Love? Creativity? wait. there is none. FFS, We couldnt even get a new stasis or void melee or any new powers for that matter? The new world is so bland and filled with reused assests its a joke.

Esse joghttps:store.steampowered.comapp1113000Persona_4_Goldeno com certeza deixou uma marca em mim, assim como os outros deixaram. Os personagens com certeza são o ponto mais alto desse jogo, todos os seus companheiros são bem presentes durante a história, e com exceção de um, todos são bem agradáveis de fazer os social links e assistir eles interagindo entre si, esse jogo inteiro passa uma vibe muito mais ''alegre'' do que todos os outros e você sente bastante isso em todo mundo. Eles tem bastante aquela energia de ''amizade boba de amigos de um anime de escola'' e mesmo que isso dava uma cansada em alguns pontos da história, eu ainda curti. Dito isso, spoilerMeu Deus como eu fiquei de saco cheio do Teddie várias vezes. Acho que isso é simplesmente um estilo de humor que os japoneses gostam que não desce em mim, mas esse negócio de ficar, ''nossa, eu quero muito ver minhas amigas ficarem peladas e namorar com elas, haha!'' começa a encher o saco. Se fosse uma vez ou outra eu não veria problema, esses momentos fazem parte dos outros jogos também, mas depois de um tempo, parece que o Teddie só consegue abrir a boca pra falar disso, e as vezes ficava até pior já que o Yosuke entrava nessa pira junto. Depois da metade pro fim do jogo, eu só tava achando ele muito esquisitão do que qualquer outra coisa.spoiler Bom, mas excluindo essa parte, gostei bastante dos personagens! A história do jogo consegue te prende bastante, principalmente da metade pro fim, onde todas as peças do mistério começam a se encaixar, sempre que eu abria o jogo eu ficava naquela mini ansiedade pra saber o que iria acontecer em seguida, e adorei o antagonista principal, provavelmente meu personagem favorito do jogo inteiro! Toda a estética do jogo no combate, nas músicas e quando você está só passeando na cidade construindo os social links é muito marcante, era muito normal eu simplesmente ficar balançando a cabeça no ritmo da música enquanto eu jogava. Quanto ao combate, joguei o jogo inteiro no difícil e foi um desafio bem agradável pra mim que sempre deixar os jogos um pouco mais difíceis que o normal, vencer os bosses principais era bem satisfatório. Em geral, jogo muito bom! Entendo como esse foi o jogo que realmente colocou a Atlus no mapa e como ele conseguiu tocar tantas pessoas, se você jogou e gostou de ter jogado tanto o 3 quanto o 5, aqui tem tudo que você gosta! One of the best games, I love it. Granted there are somethings that have aged poorly but it is just a nice game even with that Un hermoso juego, con personajes increíbles, una historia para recordar, un buen sistema de peleas y un hermoso final.

I really did. But after nearly 55 hours, its still deeply disappointing. h2Made in USA and From Mother Russia with Loveh2 1.No, this isnt a joke or a jab. The whole game feels like a Russia vs. USA are trying to relive their Cold War era. Why even set it in Europe if all we get are a few AI-controlled Latvian, Lithuanian, and Estonian units, and every Leopard 2 is crewed by Americans? I came in expecting a CIS vs NATO scenario. Instead, I got Russia vs USA in the Baltics for some reason. Even the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 campaign made more geopolitical sense. Where are the European forces? Apparently, Russia threatened nukes if Europe steps in. spoilerLets ignore the fact that France doesnt have a no-first-use policy, meaning theyd probably launch a tactical nuke at Russia as a warning shot.spoiler So were just shredding Article 5 now? Cool. I get the need for balance, so I wont even touch the fact that the T-14 Armata is portrayed as a real battle tank, or that the RAH-66 Comanche randomly shows up like its just supposed to be here, with all Its might and glory of 2 prototypes. A genuine positive: Nothing boosts my serotonin quite like hearing a Russian unit yell Parada moy! Googled it. Might be wrong. Still love it. h2Its a Multiplayer Experience, All Righth2 1.If you get lucky with a competent teamand an equally competent enemyit can be fun. Sadly, those matches are rarer than a solar eclipse. 2.Splitting CIS from the rest of the world could work until a Russian player joins, types in Cyrillic, and my Slavic brother in Christ, Im sorryI cant read Russian. That is, if he doesnt disconnect or get booted by the servers. Honestly, who knows anymore. 3.Speaking of disconnects: if you havent been randomly booted yet, count your blessings. Let me paint a picture: 3.1: You get disconnected mid-match. 3.2: Try to reconnectnope. 3.3: Restart the gamestill nope. 3.4: Restart Steamnope again. 3.5: Restart your PCcongrats! Youve now deserted the match hope those 20 minutes of playing were worth it. 4.Now imagine this: 4.1: Youre in a 5v5. 4.2: Two teammates rage-quit, because, their attack failed. 4.3: Youre left juggling their units while trying to hold the front. 4.4: They dont return, so theyre marked as deserters. 4.5: No AI fill-ins. No surrender vote. No mechanics to try and balance the game. 4.6: Youre stuck in a lopsided match, wasting your time. Want a fairer experience? Go play Wargame: Red Dragon 2. 5.Cheaters? Of course. Server crashes? Frequent. Quick fixes for leavers? Nonexistent. Surrender option? Still waiting. h348,99h3 For this price, I could buy Wargame: Red Dragon 2 with all expansions and still have money left for snacks. Charging nearly 50 for a game with this many issues is laughable. I didnt want to write this reviewI hoped for updates and fixes. But its reached a point where I just dont care anymore. Overall: Wait for major patches or a deep sale. Right now, this game is not worth 50. Oyun gayet güzel. Until Optimization improves, this game is pretty much a less than enjoyable experience to play long term Russia is completely overpoweredthey outperform U.S. troops in every aspect. It feels like the developers are too enamored with the Russian faction, which is seriously damaging the overall game balance. I strongly recommend holding off on buying until proper rebalancing has been confirmed. Game has balancing issues, anti aircraft units cant take out helicopters, tanks struggle to kill a scout car, tanks die to small arms fire, a scout sniper killed one of my tanks.... like in what world is that possible? the game is a great game and i love this RTS but it should be in alpha, not only that but poor anti cheat, 2 matches in a row ive had enemy tanks spawning next to mine, people having unlimited funds and spamming units, i captured 11 objectives and had a 9.5KD yet it was not enough, everyone on my team didnt have a kd below 6, i call in artillery on a unit and enemy moves it as if he can see my artillery fire area before they have even shot, game is a great concept but needs serious work to its anti cheat and to its balancing, most matches russia spam wins due to russian units being stronger and cheaper and having longer range im level 14 and havent lost a single match as russia yet ive lost most matches as america, i get each unit has there own strengths etc but i cant do anything against a t14 while it out ranges anything i bring, my decoy flares never stop a missile from hitting my aircraft or helicopters but 70 stop the enemys, my stingers run out of ammo before even 1 helicopter was killed, anti air doesnt always do anti air things, my pac 2 anti aircraft locked in on my teammates supply drop killing 1k points worth of troops, no enemy or missile was anywhere close to it, also, my anti air mostly just shoot and miss, enemy wants to bring in a nuke? my anti air should shoot it down right? nope it waits for the nuke to drop before shooting the B2 down, even tho it was well within range like 1000m before it dropped the nuke, there are so many positives to this game yet so many negatives too, fix balancing and add betetr anti cheat if this game has any and it will finally be playable, there are plenty of matches where things go smoothly, no ceaters and each unit does what its supposed too but then other game it all seems borked Hi so the game is sooo awesome but i have some drops in frame rate so i think you guys need to optimize it better thank you Bestes RTS 好玩就完了 gut",0.0,20000.0,0.0

But I have a boyfriend, so I don't want to date right now. You can date in Persona games, so you can do that instead. I hope you find cool girlfriend soon. In my opinion, Persona 3 marks a turning point in how the Persona games are perceived and developed. I havent played the original Persona 3 or any of its later ports to other consoles with improvements, but from the very beginning, I can feel that the game was originally conceived in 2006 or earlier. It keeps the essence of the original while bringing improved visuals, music, and story, yet it still maintains the vibe of the earlier version. Personally, Persona 3 has become my favorite game. I love everything about itits music, story, characters, plot... in short, I like everything. Of course, like any game, it has its weak points, and as I mentioned, I havent played the earlier versions of Persona 3, but it seems to me that these issues have existed for a long time. So, why were these problems left unaddressed? Could it be that the developers thought changing these things would drastically alter the game, or do they genuinely see nothing wrong with those decisions? Either way, I have nothing more to say except this: whether you've played another Persona game or havent but enjoy turn-based games, giving this one a try would be a great idea.

This is what it's like to live in Brazil Kenshi can oddly be summarized as Morrowind, if you removed all of the quests from the game, replaced every cliff racer with daedric enemies, and then add in awful performance that cause constant loading screens from running around the map alongside bugs and other issues that will delete half of your base, get your characters killed or even remove them entirely, break your saves outright and sometimes just crash your game when trying to load a save. It's unfortunately a deceptively shallow game that is held together with rubber bands. There is a lot going on in the World of Kenshi according to dialogue from its inhabitants, but in reality its all barren and artificial. There are several different factions that have their own issues and conflicts but they are all confined to their own little bubbles and will never reach out beyond them unless you force them too, which just results in a few different npcs spawning in different areas. You can run around and explore the handful of towns spread out across this very large, dead world, and all you'll find are npcs that are flagged to fight other npcs and a few unique characters with barely a paragraphs worth of dialogue. You can interact with all of these happenings by getting beat up by bandits, or trading items that can't be used by npcs to merchants who, in the non existent economy, restock their wallet and inventory every day, or sneak around and steal from said merchants, and that's really it. There are copy and pasted ruins to find with items tailored for the tech tree research and junk that can't be used for anything other than selling, but otherwise nothing interesting to find. No underground arenas to participate in, no local attractions to sight see, no gathering of nobility to make fun of the poor, nor any grand cathedrals with altars for the pious to grovel beneath. Just more desert and more towns filled nearly identical shops and inns. Engaging with these few activities Kenshi has to offer isn't that meaningful either. The game functions mostly like an RTS so everything plays itself with the only real input from the player being minor positioning and kiting which isn't even that necessary. This creates a very boring gameplay loop that overstays its welcome due to the slow and one dimensional ways to level up your characters. Leveling up any of your characters major skills in combat, crafting, etc. will take dozens of hours if you don't explicitly focus on grinding them and have other priorities than just fighting the locals, or crafting the same cheap gear while you sit on your phone or fight the games performance issues trying to do other in game tasks. You could circumvent the grind by amassing a large number of people, but then comes the issue of annoying micromanaging of inventories, hunger and combing over everyone to check their health. Really the only thing left is the base building side of the game, but that highlights the abysmal ai pathfinding with characters getting stuck on rocks, phasing through walls and getting stuck, or just not doing anything because a small box in the back corner of the room is blocking them from entering the building at all, or the rudimentary job system causing logistical standstills with your workers just not doing things sometimes. There is charm in its ideas and passion behind its creation, but Kenshi, devoid of the abstract, is just a mechanical and technical mess that feels like its wasting your time by pretending its ambition and scope are reality while gating the meaningful and interesting content with a tedious grind that prevent's you from fully experiencing the world presented and hiding most of it in nooks and crevices that blend in with identical ruins and lifeless structures. when running away from anything tap R, thank me later juego culiao me vicio XD You ever wanted to die, but never wanted to actually do it.

Хорошая игра жанра Medieval Total War, но с вовлечение в виде возможности принимать участие в битве непосредственно. Но кучей недоработанных механик на которые положили болт. Закрыли основные - игра была бы шедевральна. Плюсы: 1. Это игра аля Medieval Total War. Зарубы сотен мужикии не только в форме. Кони, стрелы, камни с неба, Вьетнам. 2. Одевайтераздевайте своего перса и подчинённых как душе угодно, доспехов много моды. Тяжесть брони имеет как плюсы так и минусы. Как и длина оружия. 3. Тактика и торговля. Бегайте, договаривайтесь, торгуйте, нападайте, выполняйте задания. 4. Прокачка персонажа. 5. В бою можно самому бегать и махать огромным топором, но не просто, а правильно фехтовать. 6. Возможность создать собственное королевство и захватить мир. Минусы. Минусов тоже много, но в основном они связаны с недоделанными механиками. 1. Командовать в бою можно, но войска тебя плохо слушают если ты в пылу схватки нельзя отдалить камеру и дать ряд приказов, к примеру, коннице. Хотите чтобы конница промчалась сквозь строй лучников? Извольте родить слона. Банальное в атаку на строй - кони побегут в рассыпную до ближайших противников. 2. Нельзя отдавать команды катапультам ни при осаде ни при штурме. А стреляют они, по принципу на какой бок хер лёг. Разве что при штурме можешь сам за нее сесть. 3. Дипломатия. Считай в лейт гейме её нет, а точнее она максимально проста. Можно индивидуально повышать доверие персонажей. Но как только ты стал королевством, как-то договориться, объявить совместную войну, просто нормально платить дань без необходимости регулярных заруб - нет. 4. Спутники ничего не говоря просто сваливают в закат если им что-то не нравится. Итог. Игра очень сильно затягивает. Хоть и приходится постоянно бороться с кривыми механиками. И в лейте веьма разочаровывает. Пи.Эс. Как уже писал. Если бы разрабы в аддонах починили механики - игра была бы мега крута.

Best gaming comeback of all time as far I'm concerned I have been playing since the Beta version many years ago. I enjoyed the development and limited thinking required after a hard day's work. But recently, especially with the Beacon update, there is a strong push towards Pantheistic religion that I do not appreciate and take a lot of offence to. At least once every 5 to 10 Overseer decisions is based on having to pray to some natural god of wind or water. If you want to be a Pantheist, that is your God given right to make that choice, but to do not force it down your players' throats. If the developers persist in pushing their Pantheistic agenda down players' throats they should lose many players; personally I will not longer subject myself to these so called decisions. You may argue it is just a game, but we all know games has become much more than just games with the level of interaction and emotion it can evoke in us. There is only one true God, and that is the great I AM, the Creator of the real world we live in. https:youtu.ben3LO-T6MeVE Alto vicio eh UYES ABSOLUTELY COP THIS",5000000.0,10000000.0,7071067.811865473

Next thing I know, its 2 am and Im googling what pets go well together in google. Planet Zoo is genuinely one of the best managementbuilding games Ive played. The animals are ridiculously detailedlike, they have personalities and little quirks, and it makes your zoo feel alive. Ive caught myself just sitting there watching the elephants play in the water. No shame. The building system is super powerful. Its not easy at first honestly, it humbled me, but once you figure it out, you can make some insane stuff. Total creative freedom. Want to build a fully themed rainforest sanctuary with custom signs and ambient sounds? Go for it. Want to just plop down pre-built stuff and focus on running the zoo? That works too. What I didnt expect was how much thought goes into caring for the animals. You have to learn what each species needs to be happyterrain, space, food, social groups, enrichment, all of it. Its detailed, but in a fun, addicting way. Also, theres conservation goals and education stuff woven in, which I actually really liked. Makes it feel meaningful, not just like a zoo tycoon game from 2004. Is it perfect? Not quite. The interface can feel a little overwhelming at first, and building with 1,000 pieces can get a little fiddly. But the game keeps getting updated, and the community is awesome if you ever need help or inspiration. If youre into animals, building sims, or just want to create your dream zoo and stress about habitat temperatures, this game is 100 worth it.

After years of admittedly rough patches and DLCs that felt more like bandaids, the latest expansion has utterly transformed the game. For a long time, Victoria 3 felt like a promise unfulfilled. The core concept was there, but the execution often left me wanting more. The economy could be opaque, diplomacy felt shallow, and the overall experience often lacked the dynamic depth we expect from a Paradox grand strategy title. But with this new DLC, it's like a different game entirely. The revamped trade system, the genuinely impactful diplomatic options, and the depth added to various internal mechanics have breathed new life into the Victorian era. I'm no longer just staring at menus; I'm actively engaging with a vibrant, complex world where my decisions truly matter. This isn't just a small improvement; it's a monumental leap forward. If you, like me, were initially disappointed and set Victoria 3 aside, now is the time to come back. The developers have clearly listened to feedback, and their dedication has paid off. Victoria 3 is finally the grand strategy masterpiece it was always meant to be. Bravo, Paradox! You've earned this positive review.",1000000.0,2000000.0,1414213.5623730957

The graphics were stunning, and the animals were incredibly cute seriously, I couldnt stop smiling at them. The music and sound design were top-notch and really pulled me into the world. The story had the perfect length, keeping me engaged from start to finish without dragging on. Overall, it was a super fun experience that I genuinely enjoyed. The humor was a huge highlight for me. The AI girls were hilarious and full of personality, and the random in-game ads were so unexpectedly funny I found myself laughing way more than I expected. It gave the game a unique charm that really stood out. The only downside was the platforming. Sometimes when jumping between platforms, it felt like tiny micro-pixels or edge detection issues caused my character to miss the jump or fail to grab a ledge, which could be frustrating.

Если вы ,вдохновившись My Summer Car или Voices of the void, искали игру с меланхоличным геймплеем, и атмосферой одиночества посреди пустыни. А именно такие ассоциации вызывает словосочетание, Заправка по среди пустыни. ЭТА ИГРА ВАМ НЕ ПОДОЙДЕТ! Авторы игры считают, что если оставить игрока в спокойствии на 20 секунд, то игроку станет скучно и он удалит игру. Поток машин сравним не с пустыней, а с МКАДом в ЧасПик. И не верьте игре, которая говорит, что количество клиентов зависит от рейтинга вашей станции. Оно зависит от количества бензоколонок, количества парковок, и количества товаров. Пример: Когда колонка одна, заправку ждут 2 клиента, когда колонки 3, заправку ждут 4-5 клиентов. За 30 игровых дней, я уходил от станции дальше склада 3 раза. Когда надо было включить генератор в первую ночь. Когда надо было спуститься к Густаву по квесту. И когда я запрыгнул в кабриолет к симпатичной брюнетке, и планировал умчатся в закат из этого ада. Игра в теории имела огромный потенциал, меланхолия, мистика и атмосфера одиночества. И мистика тут есть, как призрак или НЛО, но вместо крипоты, это унылый декор, который использовал СИМС еще лет 20 назад. Игра из перспективы быть атмосферным симулятором превращена в Кликкер. Веселая ферма, только в 3Д. В защиту игры, скажу, что хоть это и Кликкер, но кликкер не плохой. Геймплей затягивает, атмосфера и саунддизайн хороши. Моя оценка не объективна, потому что от игры я ждал другого. И она не оправдала моих ожиданий. Ich habe dieses Game jetzt fast durchgespielt und ich finde es richtig gut.

And we aren't just talking the Story Mode, which in itself feels massive. Even the online, assuming you got some friends, is a blast. That is, if you don't get a lobby with hackers and griefers. I managed to get 8 people to jump in to this game recently and play online with me. I was already close to 400 hours before even getting into the online gameplay. I've easily sank more into the game now that I'm playing with folks. If I could just have a Wild West Simulator that's nearly the same gameplay and style as RDR2 and RDO, I think that would do it for me. This game will have you laughing, crying, and cursing. Sometimes all at the same time. The game is BEAUTIFUL on a 9070xt and 9700x with 64 gb DDR5 RAM. And very smooth. However, I've played through this game on a 970 back in the day. This game isn't meant to be rushed. You are meant to take you time exploring the areas, listening, hunting, tracking, cooking, ect. Not to mention taking care of the camp and making sure Dutch stays out of trouble. He says he has a plan, but I don't know. If you want a good cry, max out honour before you complete the main story. I know I was in tears. And I've played through it twice. Same Choices. Every time. 8.510 This is simply due to the lack of Rockstar Moderation and Content Updates that they neglected from RDO.

Cпустя время он решил расширить свои земли, что у него и получилось. У него в своем городе земли были довольно не плодородны, да и руд не бывало. Задумался феодал и понял, что нужно возводить города на новых участках, там и земли и руды прекрасны. Все шло у него, как по маслу. В городе овцы и разнообразие пищи, в корчме крестьяне бурно радовались элю. И вот через время возвел поселения на местах иноземных и решил между ними бартер устроить. Все через время у него понемногу случалось. Город богател, шло 31 лето, июнь и эта конченная игра блять крашнулась и удалила мой сейв. 600р заплатил за галимое говно Like many have written, this is an unpolished game with potential to be okay. After several hours playing and several hours researching how to perform better in the game, my conclusion is you can do everything right... and still fail. Not much to do besides micro villagers between jobs by clicking on buildings, which is more irritating than fun at least banished had a menu for that...it's very easy to make an army and take over the map, maybe wait for the update as there is nothing too fun or unique about this game ATM and it seems to be missing tonnes of content, it's kind of a mashup of banished, foundation and ostriv but they are all better Le jeu est bon mais il manque VRAIMENT de end game. On peut finir une partie en 3 a 4 heures si on joue bien. Un peu plus de technologie ou de niveaux de developpement auraient ete agreables. Neanmoins je laisse un avis positif pour le potentiel que le jeu a, il est en early apres tout.. Absolutely love this game. Never have really been into city builders but I keep finding myself coming back to this game and binging it for weeks straight. I do wish the updates would come out a little quicker, but I understand its a small developer.

Devs are crazy, game is already quite expensive, but the DLC pricing is insanely high compared to the amount of content each of them add to the game. I could recommand the game if the devs could consider stop milking us. I was surprised by how much I liked this game. I thought it would be humdrum based on the half-way greyscale color scheme, but it caught me right up. Classes, levels, tactical combat, choices matter sometimes, but not really that much, professions, missions, some open-world feeling, different paths...it all kind of worked out for a while. It is a surprisingly-well-balanced game. Graphics are a bit underdeveloped, but it might be for ambience. Music is very upbeat-dark-ages. Combat is between simple and complex depending on your party and load-out, and makes sense. The world is well-designed. To date, 52 hours of play time the only glitch I've found is a character which has twice escaped me and been re-captured, then turned in to a jail, is still in my encampment and can be assigned to a position, but from which I seem to gain nothing. After 52 hours of play with only one glitch is something I can forgive. I'm not sure about the 8 DLCs, but the base came is worth the full price. 4.1 out of 5 stars.

I love this game and can't wait to try the new DLC!!! : Good game when it works ; don't expect much stability over updates if you play on linux. However, for those who have played the original game, or its extended edition, this will feel like a dimmer, sketchier version. Hence my negative review. Dimmer, because, well : the original game was colorful, illustrations of powers, gods, techs, environments and light works, were colorful and evocative. Retold replaced all that with what i would at times almost call grimdark fantasy, or at the very least very generic, maybe dull, and sometimes off-topic. The overall feeling is like the game wants to be edgyserious, instead of being what it is, ie fun and lighted. Even in the overall environments and game assets, i feel a tone down of color that also makes reading difficult. The sketchy part comes from a, much, much more demanding game engine that will just provide you with higher quality graphics showing lower quality art again, dimmer, duller. It is to me all but a good tradeoff. Original game and extended edition worked better on my 20 years old windows 7 computer, than Retold on my 1080 GTX-based gaming setup. 딱 옛날에 먹었던 추억의 그 맛임 아르칸토스의 여정을 추억속에서 기억하고 있던 사람이라면 재밌게 할 수 있음 근데 번역 개선 모드랑 구버전 더빙 모드는 꼭 설치하고 하십시오 찐빠가 장난 아닙니다 많은 리마스터 게임들이 그렇듯 추억이 없는 사람들에게도 추천할만한 게임인진 잘? 모르겠음 근데 캠페인만 해도 꽤 넉넉한 분량이라 이건 안 해봤는데 AOE 시리즈는 재밌게 했었다 정도인 사람들에겐 나름 추천할만하지 않나.. 싶기도 함",500000.0,1000000.0,707106.7811865465

Thumbs Sideways Great Tech, Underwhelming Gameplay Loop Theres a lot to like about Shapez 2 on the surface. The factory structures are visually interesting and suggest a promising future. The graphics are clean and modern, the interface is intuitive and slick, and I didnt encounter a single bug during my playthrough which is no small feat for an early release. However, the core gameplay loop left me wanting more. The constraints system which could have added challenge and creativity barely factored into my experience. I never came close to hitting the structure limits, so it didnt really influence my designs. Side quests start off engaging but quickly become repetitive and feel disconnected from the rest of the game. Once youve completed the factory for a quest, it has no ongoing purpose, making it feel like a one-and-done effort with little payoff. The operator badge path alone provided more than enough science to complete progression, making side quests largely irrelevant past the early game. Unlike Factorio, where your early builds continue to support and evolve into your later infrastructure, Shapez 2 factories feel isolated and disposable. Each one solves a narrow problem, then gets ignored. Theres no sense of a growing, interconnected machine. The shape mechanics, while initially novel, lack depth. Id love to see a system where advanced shapes are constructed from simpler ones a hierarchy where youre constantly building up from base components. Imagine only starting with quarter circles and squares and needing to combine and split them to reach complex forms similar to the color mixing system, which is far more satisfying in comparison. Lastly, it would be a huge improvement if producing shapes was actually necessary to build new structures. That would tie your creations directly to progression and give a real sense of purpose to what youre building. Bottom Line: Shapez 2 has excellent production values and real potential, but the current gameplay loop feels shallow. Heres hoping future updates bring more depth and interconnectedness to match the polish.Thumbs Sideways Great Tech, Underwhelming Gameplay Loop Theres a lot to like about Shapez 2 on the surface.

The operator badge path alone provided more than enough science to complete progression, making side quests largely irrelevant past the early game. Unlike Factorio, where your early builds continue to support and evolve into your later infrastructure, Shapez 2 factories feel isolated and disposable. Each one solves a narrow problem, then gets ignored. Theres no sense of a growing, interconnected machine. The shape mechanics, while initially novel, lack depth. Id love to see a system where advanced shapes are constructed from simpler ones a hierarchy where youre constantly building up from base components. Imagine only starting with quarter circles and squares and needing to combine and split them to reach complex forms similar to the color mixing system, which is far more satisfying in comparison. Lastly, it would be a huge improvement if producing shapes was actually necessary to build new structures. That would tie your creations directly to progression and give a real sense of purpose to what youre building. Bottom Line: Shapez 2 has excellent production values and real potential, but the current gameplay loop feels shallow. Heres hoping future updates bring more depth and interconnectedness to match the polish. A very fun automation game, I was glued to it for hours. Juegazo",200000.0,500000.0,316227.7660168382

Una raid muy inmersiva y un contenido fuera de raid bastante fresco y divertido, lo recomiendo mucho. PD: voy a extrañar mucho leer libros de lore de toda esta saga de luz... y oscuridad Primero que nada, el juego no es del todo malo, tiene muchas cosas increíbles y muchísimo contenido ademas que desafíos interesantes y demandantes. Los DLC's son muy llamativos y dan horas de contenido que mucho es de calidad, ademas que al comprarlos no se sienten como pay to win de hecho en el contenido gratuito se consiguen mejores cosas simplemente amplían tu arsenal llenándolo de posibilidades. Con este juego he pasado horas increíbles, tanto en solitario contemplando los paisajes como en con mis amigos completando actividades y mejorando el armamento Pero entonces por que no lo puedo recomendar? Pese a lo bueno que es, el juego es horrible para nuevos jugadores, tiene una trama e historia fascinante y entrañable, pero el hecho de que no este completa y no se pueda jugar de ningún modo coherente simplemente hace que te sientas desubicado y con muchas dudas con el juego. Muchos de los personajes tiene buena escritura pero están entrelazados a eventos pasados que ya no se pueden jugar, entendiendo el porque están ahí pero sin transmitir emoción que muchos veteranos si tuvieron haciendo una experiencia poco homogénea en la comunidad. Ademas de las actividades gratuitas y de early game el juego tiene una curva de dificultad muy retadora, obligándote a jugar con amigos o aprendiendo mucho meta y mecánicas. El tutorial no sirve como introducción ni de dichas mecánicas muestra lo básico pero no te dice nada de las stats ni tampoco te da contexto suficiente de la historia. Al forzar a otros a pagar por actividades a sobreprecio y a entrar a una historia muy desconectada hace que sea difícil convencer a otros jugadores y enseñarles a jugar este juego. Ademas últimamente las decisiones de Bungie son cada vez más cuestionables en su dirección y el hecho de que se borra contenido sin la posibilidad de re jugarlo hace que te plantees 2 veces si realmente vale la pena en invertir en el. Seguiré jugandolo probablemente mucho más tiempo y probablemente también le agarres cariño pero es difícil y cada vez se pone peor... A satisfiying conclusion of the past 7 years of story. Even better raid. I have a blast playing this, but it's sad that despite the success, Bungie as a company still have to cut lots of the talents that worked in this masterpiece. Prismatic has been very refreshing and fun to play with. Despite the dwindling in-game players, lots of the activity are still playable and I do enjoy teaching the mechanic of old dungeons to new players. All in all, I hope this game can still going strong, but seeing the new Bungie, I can't keep my hope up. So I try to enjoy the moment and cherish the good memories,",0.0,20000.0,0.0

That is not something I believe anyone is denying. However you can't take all the possible issues and compare them to your experience. Mine has been pretty light in terms of issues or bugs encountered, and definitely within reason for any game I would play and at the time of this writing, the game is still within Early Access. Ark has held a special place in my list of games ever since it's initial release while I was on a shoddy laptop. I would recommend this game to anybody who enjoys Survival games. It's spin on the genre - and the inclusion of Big Reptile - make it an experience even if you play casually. I would recommend any new players hold off on any Flying mounts until they really explore the map, it's gorgeous and such a different experience on the ground than the detached feel you eventually get flying over the map. A gorgeous flight, but you tend to get into that Autopilot of just going from A to B. Walk around, die to Raptors a couple hundred times, live the Ark experience. For fans of Evolved, Ascended has taken Evolved and made it gorgeous, The enhancements to the UI and certain QoL features make this game an amazing remaster. The integrated modding system is far easier than the previous methods for solo play and managing a Server. There is more of a monetary system for certain mods, but the Free original DLC was a great choice and all the better that they reintroduce new DLC and Content that you can buy to enhance your experience for those who want more than a basic remaster. Whether you're looking for an experience solo, or with friends, there's so much this game has to offer, I find all these arguments of Pay-to-win are null. It doesn't detract from the base experience unless you're looking to hop into Official. At which point Ark has the same experience you'd associate with Rust servers in terms of the tribes you will likely meet. , maybe catch it on the next Sale and if it's not for you - so be it. As much as I would love to like this game, these developers genuinely don't deserve anymore money. They lack the capability or will to optimize virtually fing anything, there's a million and a half problems you run into trying to play the game. Keeping the game going and playing normally is like walking on a tight rope. You change one setting and it all just fumbles down. On top of that, the games enormous. I have over 6000 hours in Atlas, and Atlas was ran better than this. It makes no sense. If this game were owned by anyone else, it would be amazing. As far as the game itself, it can be fun, for sure. Tons of content, things to do, farm, etc. But holy hell are there bugs and optimization issues. Just play something else.

For me personally, other than the main part of the game there isn't anything else to do in the game. When the game released it was fun, but I feel like they should of had some update or content pre-made before publishing the full game. Instead, players had to wait a long time just for an update, but by that time the game already lost most of its players.

I stopped listening to community thoughts and feedback the second the servers came online, and except for a few breaks- I played for about 12 to 13 hours till 3am in the morning doing just the story on legendary. Give or take a few hours, I tried to round down the time it took. I don't get where a lot of the hate is coming from, or why people are saying stuff like the 'ball mechanic' was shoved down their throat. Literally everyone I've seen that complains about says that line like they're reading a teleprompter on how to trash the DLC. I'm not saying they're wrong for having their opinions, it just feels more like people are confirmation biased that the DLC is bad, only looking for cracks that confirm their opinions. I'm not saying the DLC is perfect, but for blinding myself to expectations for a full day and just playing--I felt like I had a good time. I enjoyed the mechanics after I got used to them; and even if I was frustrated at some puzzles when I got stuck, I still enjoyed the fact they required any amount of brain power at all. Some of them--at least near the end of the campaign reminded me of Portal 2 puzzles. Now, not all of them were like that, but it was overall a good experience still. I don't want to give an opinion on the other content, as one day in and I haven't even been able to touch anything but the story till now. I will say that once I got used to stuff like the Portal in the Director, I quite liked it. I think 'some' of the distaste people are having is just getting used to new things--could be wrong though. Uh- oh, check out the 'Primer' shader in the shop this week if you can. It looks pretty awesome--making a lot of things in-game look like you've stripped them of textures almost. Regardless, just have fun playing the game. Sometimes it's a little disheartening to see people just not allowing themselves to do what they want and have fun. Cringe I assume, and probably some bad grammatical errors as well in that; but I hope ya'll have a good day! People are yapping, if you like destiny this expansion is good. Curse of Osiris is nothing compared to this DLC. Lightfall was garbage compared to this DLC. New loot chase, new puzzle mechanics and the story finally feels like What is gonna happen next Everyone who is complaining about puzzles or repetitiveness has the attention span of a single cell organism. No. Ich finde das DLC gelungen. Es geht mal in eine andere Richtung, mit Rätseln usw.

Felt like a downgrade: slow, clumsy, some useful stuff that was in the 2019 version is not there anymore. Dear Adobe, you could do so much better with the resources at your disposal, and if not upgrade this soft than at least nor ruin what you had. Si eres artista 3d y te dedicas a algo donde usas el Substance, compratelo, estaba harto de buscar siempre la version gratuita en cada update y jugarmela con el PC. Pienso que vale mucho la pena la version perpetua de steam. Y sincermnete me da igual si en un futuro salen mas updates, esta version me durara toda la vida, porque al final ya esta muy pulido el programa. Por cierto , odio ADOBE hasta la medula, nunca pagueios mensualidades , pero en este caso con la perpetual es una buena opcion de compra. please include all of the .so files into the installation of substance and not symlinked as my arch install doesn't have libtiff.so.5. ฉนไมไดใชงานมน แตฉนไมเขาใจวาทำไมมนถงนบวาฉนใชงานไปแลว 41 ชวโมง ฉนทำงาน ใน Adobe substance ทฟรของนกเรยนแทนแลว ตอนทมนไมยอมตดบตรอตโนมตใหฉน และฉนรสกแยมาก ททาง steam ยงไมยอมคนเงนใหฉน ละไมยอมตรวจสอบอยางเปนธรรม ฉนตองการเงนรายเดอนของฉนคน So where to begin with why this is a downgrade. I bought the 2022 version years back and saw there were several new features that I wanted to try for the 2025 version so I ended up buying it. 1: Stylized Filter 2: Better Font Importing System 3: Spline Based Texturing for things like laces - for starters Well... its a downgrade for many reasons 1: Importing assets - WHY ON EARTH did you make it to where you have to toggle each individual box to import assets like alphas, materials, etc. I work with a studio and we have 100 assets and there is no 'select all' button for alphas or for other importing features and you have to toggle..each..individual...piece. 2: They changed layers to look like material spheres in the layers panel when in previous versions it was a box showing the color. This was a HUGE downgrade because now you struggle to see what color is in the layer and it clutters up the layers panel with bad clutter. BIG THING YOU NEED TO REVERT 3: The 2025 version has a LOT more bugs, specifically with masks. I use the moss mask and other masks and if you drop a smart mask onto any layer, material, etc. The smart material just creates a new layer or bugs in many different ways. Huge problem. 4: The stylized filter - We have seen it in teasers, youtubers, etc. This was the reason I got the 2025 version and it is VERY beta. Nearly 20 different filters and seems like only 5 of them works somewhat and the results vary greatly between models for things like hand painted filter. 5: Performance - the 2022 version of substance runs MUCH better at idle and in action than the 2025 version. I run with a 5060TI and 32GB of Ram with this program on an SSD and there are issues with performance drops and other hiccups. 6: The UI has log errors pop up as its own tab and personal settings for docking appear to glitch a lot and revert back to Adobe standard. Gets annoying when you work for a studio and you are opening 20-30 assets a day to work on a game engine. Overall: There are some cool flashy features, but SWEET FANCY MOSES Adobe why did so much get changed for the negative including rampant bugs. You charge 200 for a perpetual license or a 25 sub for something that has a lot of issues. Going to run my 2025 version but if I want to try and do some stylized filters or more custom stuff I will just use 2025 despite the bad performance.",0.0,20000.0,0.0
