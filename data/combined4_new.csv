534380,Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Reloaded Edition,2022-02-03,146951,79,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Action;Adventure;RPG,$39.99,$13.19 USD,"5,000,000 .. 10,000,000",1258,"Na początku mojej przygody z Dying Light 2 skupiłem się głównie na szybkim przejściu fabuły, co szczerze mówiąc nie zrobiło na mnie dużego wrażenia. Gra wydawała się wtedy trochę nijaka. Jednak postanowiłem zacząć od nowa, tym razem skupiając się bardziej na eksploracji, misjach pobocznych i ogólnym klimacie świata. I to była świetna decyzja. Z czasem gra naprawdę mnie wciągnęła. Klimat miasta, poczucie zagrożenia i chaosu wszystko jest bardzo dobrze oddane. Mechanika walki jest świetna brutalna, dynamiczna i satysfakcjonująca. Każda walka daje frajdę, zwłaszcza gdy nauczysz się wykorzystywać otoczenie i parkur. A skoro już o tym mowa parkur to temat, który budzi u mnie mieszane uczucia. Z jednej strony daje dużo swobody i radości z przemieszczania się po mieście, ale z drugiej czasami działa, jak chce. Zdarzało się, że postać nie złapała się krawędzi, mimo że wyraźnie powinna, albo że nie mogłem zejść w dół po złapaniu się jakiejś krawędzi. Trochę frustrujące, ale da się przyzwyczaić. W porównaniu do pierwszej części Dying Light miało nieco inny klimat, bardziej surowy i mroczny, którego trochę mi tu brakuje. Mimo to, dwójka nadal trzyma wysoki poziom i oferuje masę dobrej zabawy. Moja ocena: 8.510 zdecydowanie warto zagrać, szczególnie jeśli lubisz połączenie parkuru, walki i klimatu postapo. To be fair, I'm early on. Still, I'll cover the very few let downs for me, before singing the game's praises. I honestly hoped this continued Kyle Crane's story. I just got attached to that character, and was hoping for some sense of progression with the skills I had already gained from the first game. I didn't look into what this game was before I bought it, though. That said, Aiden is quickly growing on me. The combat just doesn't feel as fluid as the first game. That will likely improve as I gain more skills, but this guy is supposed to be someone who's been a Pilgrim for years. That and the gene therapy he had I'm assuming that's what it was, he should already be a bad. Now, the positives. I mean, where to start? The game is beautiful, run's smooth, and the story already has me hooked! I can see how the parkour and combat will become better with more skills and stats, even if it's a bit of a pain for now. I love how the protagonists and characters are done in the Dying Light games! There's genuine personality and it feels more like how people would really act and speak in the world they are in. The side quests are fairly unique and satisfying, much like the Witcher. I'm also a fan of stealth being a factor in the game. Honestly, despite the few things that felt like a temporary let down, I'd easily call this game a 910 for the type of game it is. It may be 1010 by the time I finish : I do hope to try the coop at some point. I can see how this one is far better designed for an engaging coop experience, than the first one. Keeping in mind, the first one was still really good. All in all, AWESOME job dev team! this game made me kill a dog and is full of bugs after like 3 years of being on steam 6666666666 fun game but def failed expectations. I swear they remade this whole game after they fired the lead bc of some made up me too movement thing. Feels like they auto generated the whole world rinse and repeat but combat is fun and hopefully the beast is the complete opp when it comes to world.. graphics look way better in the next one but as a dying light fan you should play the whole series.",5000000.0,10000000.0,7071067.811865473

Si bien no inventa nada nuevo y deja bastante claros cuáles son sus referentes, vayamos por partes con lo que más me ha gustado: La jugabilidad recuerda mucho a títulos como The Elder Scrolls, pero con un giro interesante: el simple hecho de añadir un dash y mecánicas de parry lo vuelve mucho más dinámico y entretenido. El apartado artístico es simplemente sublime. Los paisajes, el diseño de entornos y personajes, el equipo... Todo está impregnado de alma y ese toque oscuro y decadente que personalmente me fascina. No hay un solo rincón que no transmita esa atmósfera. La banda sonora es potente, con varios temas memorables que brillan en momentos clave. Y el mayor punto fuerte: la trama. Oscura, compleja y absorbente desde el primer momento. Es cierto que decae un poco en el segundo y tercer acto, pero eso no empaña el conjunto. La historia principal mantiene el interés hasta el final. Mención especial a las misiones secundarias: algunas están a la altura de las mejores de Divinity: Original Sin II o The Witcher 3. No es poca cosa. Ahora, lo que menos me ha gustado: A nivel técnico, el juego muestra sus costuras. No hablo tanto del apartado gráfico que, aunque modesto, es bonito y funcional sino de problemas más serios: popping muy visible, caídas de rendimiento en ciertas zonas, tirones, errores visuales Por ejemplo, hay áreas enteras que no pasan de los 50 FPS a pesar de que la CPU va sobrada. Confío en que muchos de estos fallos se corrijan en futuros parches. La animación del caballo es rara y poco fluida. Da la sensación de que la mecánica se implementó deprisa y sin mucho cariño. Además, el mundo no te empuja a usarlo: caminar es más cómodo. Lo mismo ocurre con la vista en tercera persona. Entiendo que se añadió por petición de la comunidad o como medida de accesibilidad, pero sinceramente no era necesario. No se ve bien, no se controla bien, no se siente bien. Parece un mod, y uno no muy bien integrado. A pesar de estos fallos aquí y allá, Awaken Realms ha creado un universo fascinante al que me encantaría volver. Questline ha hecho un trabajo sólido con los recursos que tenía y ha sabido dar vida a una fantasía oscura rica en detalles y alma. Si te gustan los RPG de la vieja escuela, donde cada decisión importa y puedes perderte en un mundo abierto lleno de secretos si disfrutas de las ambientaciones densas y sombrías y si, como un servidor, eres fan del mito artúrico, Camelot y los caballeros de la mesa redonda, no se que esperas a jugarlo. Quickly becomes boring in the middle of Act 2 - everything is the same, enemy AI is poor and basic - even bosses are copies of each other. A lot of bugs - key NPCs for quests can disappear, sometimes you cant interact with objects, quite often you can move through textures, some quest events can crash the game... Last Act 3 - just joke - instead of grand city and finale - we have 4 villages with a lot of boring quests. I believe devs should release full game a bit later, cuz right now game looks unfinished and raw Tainted grail is REALLY good and fills that missing elder scrolls niche for the first two acts of the game, very dense, good dungeon design, fun combat for every style, nice skill trees, tons of unique magic items and spells, looks good, a few lovely characters, just a very very dense well made game then you get to the final area and it becomes extraordinarily clear that the game isn't finished. Missing geometry, bugged quests, major characters with no voice acting suddenly, no rewards from dungeons, major faction questlines ending with a very weak binary choice that affects nothing and no rewards, quests that by their description should have some complex or nuanced solutions that just summon an enemy and you kill it for no reward, less quests in general, areas and characters just showing their filenames SceneEnding_AlchemistDungeon_Final. things like that everywhere. While its understandable for a dev to have to rush a game out the door due to deadlines and investors being demons in human skin this one REALLY needed to cook for another few months to a year and just have act 3 release later. Great game up until then though, I hope the devs fix it so it lives up to its potential and ambition. One of the best classic rpgs in last years",200000.0,500000.0,316227.7660168382

These two MSX2 classics are more than just historical curiositiesthey are the foundation upon which one of gamings most iconic sagas was built. And despite their age, they still carry surprising narrative and mechanical weight. The original Metal Gear may feel rudimentary by todays standards, but it introduced a revolutionary concept: stealth as a primary gameplay mechanic. Rather than encouraging direct confrontation, the game asked players to avoid enemies, manage limited resources, and think tactically. In an era dominated by run-and-gun gameplay, this was groundbreaking. That said, the Steam version is a straight port of the MSX2 release, complete with its infamous limitations. The control scheme is stiff, enemy AI is simplistic, and there's a notable lack of in-game guidance, which may frustrate modern audiences. Yet, for those willing to look past these dated elements, the game still holds up as a fascinating piece of design history. Its the prototype blueprint of what Metal Gear Solid would later perfect. Metal Gear 2:Solid Snake is where the series truly found its voice. Mechanically, its a massive leap forward: enemies can now move across screens and detect sound, Snake can crawl and punch diagonally, and the level design feels far more intricate. The writing is also richer, offering shades of the philosophical themes Kojima would later become known forwar, loyalty, identity. While still bound by 8-bit limitations, MG2 is a far more playable and compelling experience today. The structure resembles later Metal Gear Solid entries much more closely than youd expect, and its cinematic ambitions are already taking form. If you can play only one of the two, Metal Gear 2 is the one that holds up best by modern standards. The emulation quality is stable and faithful, though very barebones. There are no enhanced features, no modern conveniences like save states, and the resolution is locked to the original pixel scale. Players used to modern emulation suites might find the presentation underwhelming. However, the bundled manuals and digital extras accessible from the launcher help contextualize the experience, especially for new players. As games, Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 are clearly products of their timebut their influence is undeniable. Nearly every game dev sim has mimicked their basic structure in some form, and their DNA runs through not just the Metal Gear franchise, but stealth games in general. Experiencing them today is like playing the Rosetta Stone of stealth gaming: flawed, fascinating, and essential. Rating: 710 Dated in form, foundational in spirit. A must-play for fans of game history or stealth genre originsjust be ready for some clunky design. Metal Gear 1 : Recommend if you want to play the original game that is said to have launched the stealth game genre and live that retro game feeling of 80-90s. Recommend if you are willing to look up on the internet and follow up guides that will probably mean bollocks to you at first because you have long gone past the point that it makes sense! Recommend if you like self torture of backtracking tedious 80's pixelated levels to get the items that nobody knows that they are there except the devs themselves! or the wizard people of old days who played this for countless hours and found those secrets themselves and wrote guides I strongly suggest casual gamers to play the game only if you are willing to put through all of these. Following a guide from start will save you from lot of frustration, but if you are into self torture like me, look up only when you have tried first on your own and nothing comes up... When you can't even say A good way to experience the very beginnings of a great series. The games, while having plenty of NES era BS, are incredibly innovative for the time, and so many of the mechanics just won't be found in games of a similar age. There's a fun arsenal of weapons to use, the pixel artwork is great, and the story is quite involved. As a remasterport, it's pretty run of the mill, but it's still nice to have a new way to play the games. My one suggestion for how to play this game if you do pick it up is to always have a guide on standby. Save yourself the frustrations from the more cryptic parts of the game, and just have fun admiring the achievements of the early days of the Metal Gear franchise.",20000.0,50000.0,31622.77660168378

Multiple types of units, like light and heavy infantry, all with unique advantages and vulnerabilities, with even more unique differences between nations' soldiers of each type.

Both the normal and enhanced versions of this game are poorly optimised. Changing graphics settings literally takes minutes. It also made my gpu fans spin super loud randomly. The game is very dark and murky looking - the textures remind me of games from the early 2010's. The story is ok and is fairly straightforward but I did find some characters a bit annoying and clingy. I liked the fully voiced and subtitled dialogue but it is poorly lip-synced. good game, though i wish there were more weaponsgadgets. volga and novosibirsk were great all of the indoormetro areas are pretty good too for the most part. I didn't really like how the caspian sea was very empty, there's just a bunch of empty ships, not much to explore or loot so it just didn't feel very rewarding going to a poi just to find nothing,, the taiga level also had this issue to a lesser degree but it was a little too linear for my taste, wasted potential with how beautiful the landscape was. overall an 810, last light is better I dont say this often but this is a master work of a game, i rarely get emotional or scared in video games but the metro series got both out of me. I had tears in my eyes from the ending parts. The game has its ups and downs but man the ups are MASSIVE.

I really dont get why the recommended layout doesnt make use of the more available buttons on the Steam Deck in the first place. Also, who approved In-game interface text is legible on Steam Deck? For me, its tiny and scaling the UI makes the whole screen covered in massive text boxes.

Gearing While it has gotten better over the years, the enhancement process is still annoying with it's extremely low chance of success and requires a TON of time sink to get the resources outside of events if you're not willing to wait for them. It does give you plenty of easy gear to get as a beginner though from the seasonal rewards, so that's a plus. PS. Seasonal character is a must if you're new. Too good to not take advantage of. CombatPvE The game's combat is really good when you get to higher levels and unlock awakeningsuccession, but some classes are still missing succession years later. You're going to be doing a LOT of grinding in this game. That's pretty much all the game is. Just tons of grinding mobs over and over or world bosses, getting mats or weapons to sell for big monies Silver. The world bosses can be highlight moments for the PvE though. At least for me. PvP While unbalanced and chaotic, the PvP can be fun when it works. emphasis on WHEN it works. The introduction of a more balanced mode, The Arena of Solare, with equalized gear is more than welcome and a nice addition. I do enjoy the PvP servers. Makes the grind zones more fun knowing there are other players around that are contesting the zones. It can lead to some funny rage moments from people getting killed. Lifeskill Oddly enough though, I found myself enjoying the games life skilling more than the combat. From chopping trees to cooking food. It's got it all! Very chill experience. I mostly fish in the oceans as my Shai. Manual fishing can be pretty fun. Graphics While it was impressive for it's time, I don't think the graphics of BDO has aged very well. I had to look up a guide on how to make the game look better. By default it's extremely blurry and a mess. I couldn't even tell what was going on from how cluttered everything was. The text on the UI being too small with no way to scale it in game There is a way by adding a custom font into the game files. After fixing it it looks better, but still a little rough. Customization The character customization is also pretty good. from an in depth dyeing system to being able to edit each indivual part of your character's body. The only thing that holds it back in my opinion is that you pretty much NEED a value pack in order to access the dyeing system which is this games form of a subscription. No one sells the dyes on the player market. Overall I'd say BDO is a great game to play and has many ways of enjoying it even with it's issues.

Non è un brutto gioco, non posso dargli pollice verso, ma guardare la mappa dopo venti ore e vedere che resta da svelarne ancora molto, ma molto più della metà, svilisce e fa tremare le gambe, specialmente se il sistema di gioco inizia pesantemente a venire a noia. Se con Origin la serie aveva avuto un'evoluzione interessante, merito soprattutto dell'intreccio e dei personaggi raccontati, in Odissey il tutto viene diluito in un titolo gargantuesco e dalla mappa sconfinata, dalle infinite attività secondarie e dallla perenne sensazione che meno sarebbe stato meglio. Non mi sento di giudicare male l'abbondanza, ma mi dispiace che per il capitolo ambientato nella Grecia antica, un'ambientazione che adoro molto più dell'Egitto di Origin, la mia attenzione non abbia retto fino ai titoli di coda, affossata da un'impalcatura di gioco che non è in grado di reggere tutta questa vastità. Resta, in ogni caso, una rappresentazione splendida della Grecia e delle sue isole, adatto soltanto a tutti quei giocatori che non avranno paura di chiudersi per centinaia di ore nel medesimo mondo, purtroppo a ripetere sempre le stesse azioni.

After spending over 250 hours in Cities: Skylines II, I feel confident saying this: its a game thats both frustrating and fantastic, often at the same time. What I Loved: Deeper Simulation: Every citizen truly has a life. The way cims choose jobs, commute, and move between cities feels more alive than ever before. Zoning Infrastructure Tools: Road tools, snapping options, and freedom of city planning are far more flexible. It's easier to build beautiful, realistic cities. Service System Overhaul: Police, fire, garbage, and health are more nuanced and realistic. Managing city services feels like managing a living, breathing system. Weather Seasons: Adds a fresh layer of immersion. Snowfall, rain, fog its all stunning. Modding Potential: While it's still in development, the base has been laid out well for creators to eventually transform this game like they did with CS1. What Needs Serious Work: Performance Issues: Even after updates, the game still suffers from stutters, FPS drops, and long load times, especially on large cities. Optimization is far from perfect. UIUX Clutter: Certain menus feel bloated or unintuitive. Accessing crucial info sometimes takes more clicks than it should. Lacking Polish: Bugs, pathfinding issues, and simulation oddities occasionally break immersion. Missing Features from CS1: Some features and DLC-quality content from the original are still missing here understandably, but noticeable. Final Thoughts: Cities: Skylines II is not a casual sequel. It tries to evolve city-building in a more realistic, detailed direction, and for that, I respect it. But it launched rough and still feels like a work-in-progress. That said, if you're passionate about city building and willing to push through its rough edges, this game can easily consume hundreds of hours just like it did for me.

Но если точнее - сначала немного напугала, капельку расстроила, минутку побесила, но спустя часа четыре раскрылась передо мной во всей своей красе! Реально, после FH45 я совсем не ждал, что какая-либо другая гоночная аркада сможет меня настолько увлечь. Самое главное достоинство этой игры - это система тюнингастайлинга в сочетании с игровой физикой, что позволяет явно ощутить каждое изменение в автомобиле. На мой взгляд, в этом аспекте CarX вообще не уступает FH, и даже в чем-то превосходит сам не верю, что пишу такое. Тюнинг у меня занимает где-то 40 всего игрового времени - очень увлекает. Это гигантское достоинство игры, из-за которого прощаешь ей множество недостатков... Играю на геймпаде, с ручным переключением передач, без помощников, на максимальном уровне сложности. Всем советую, попробовать поиграть также. Игра совсем несложная. В плане вибро-отдачи, мне не очень нравится, после Форзы - там вибрация геймпада гораздо информативней. Еще мне неочень нравится вид от третьего лица - имею ввиду и положение камеры и ее резкие смещения за рулевым стиком - здесь разрабам снова стоило бы взять пример с Форзы. Ну и последнее мое замечание касается интерфейса HUD - слишком яркий и отвлекающий видимо перекочевал из мобилок - и снова желаю разрабам изучить пример Форзы. Важное предостережение всем, кто только-только будет начинать пробовать играть в нее: Настройки по умолчанию интерфейса, управления и тп. мне показались просто отвратительными. Обязательно потратьте время, чтобы настроить все под себя!!! Настроек в игре совсем немного даже меньше чем хотелось бы. Сюжет тут, примерно, как и в Форзе - его почти нет. Ты просто гоняешь по локации, в поисках того, чем себя развлечь. Есть клубы уличных гонщиков, с которыми можно соревноваться, чтобы зарабатывать ресурсы на покупку и тюнинг автомобилей. Локации и графика в целом, выглядят скромней нежели в FH или NFS. Сетевой режим я пока что не пробовал - но позже обязательно попробую. Если замечу там что-нибудь примечательное для себя - вернусь позже и дополню отзыв. Пока что игра нравится, потраченных денег не жаль! Любителям аркадных гонок можно смело пробовать! Разрабам желаю не забрасывать этот проект, а использовать его, чтобы прокачать скиллы для следующей части CarX.

But, I wanna ramble a bit so here's my review: One of the best games I have played in my life. Finished it thrice on playstation platinum and once on PC 100 as well. h2The Storyh2 list While a bit confusing, it's super unique, emotional and have a lot of moments that definitely stick with you. I'm not gonna say anything else about it, experience it yourself, don't watch trailers or anything. list h2The Gameplayh2 list The Good: - The most important thing in my opinion, you bALWAYSb feel like that you are helping other players. All the time. The only connection that you have with other people is positive, you only interact with other players to help them or be helped by them. And the game gives you constant feedback in that regard with messages telling you how you are being useful to them. - I personally find the gameplay loop to be super engaging delivering packages. Playing on Very Hard and going everywhere by foot it's how I recommend playing it, at least the vast majority of the game. You will find the gameplay much more intense and entertaining. spoilerVehiclesspoiler and spoilerroadsspoiler can make the game monotonous, so I advice using them sparingly or not use them at all. I advice to not use any of the Director's Cut new items. They destroy the essence of the game. - You have A LOT of collectibles, weapons and tools to discover, use, craft, etc. - The ambience of this game is amazing. The overall vibe of it. It's just perfect. The Bad: - The spoilerdrivingspoiler mechanics in this game are one of the most infuriating mechanics I had the disgrace to experience. They are just awful, there is not a single spoilervehiclespoiler made to be spoilerdrived outside the roadsspoiler, and yet you are forced in some orders missions to use them in a very complicated terrain. - The physics... 99 of the time I have failed an order, it was because of how the physics work. I cannot explain them properly but anyone who has played the game knows how it feels to be walking down SLOWLY a slope and then the game detects the slope as some kind of massive cliff because you step on a small rock. Killing you andor destroying your cargo in the process. If this doesn't make any sense, it's because it doesn't make any sense. But it's how the game works. - spoilerYou can't keep the tutorial outfit.spoiler list h2Conclusionh2 list Those are the only things that annoys me. And I think those can be negative for both lovers and haters of the game so that's why I include them. That said, the game is super fun and entertaining and I am so happy that games like this exist. It's not a game for everyone, but it was certainly for me. list Мне правда нравиться эта игра, в какой-то момент она спасла на время от игровой импотенции. Да здесь проблема с транспортом, но геймплей, сюжет, графика и какая-то своя атмосфера у этой игры.

Yes, you get 5-6 jobs, at different clearance levels and different difficulties. But there's a million unlockables that don't need ANY MTX, and the DLC is cosmetic only. Not to mention the different kits and weapons you can use to vary up the experience, and generally just the experience of grouping up with others, leading to a different dynamic. You can also ping points of the map - so although there's no chat, you can still communicate. It's not a massive loss in my opinion - though I suppose it'd be nice in non-invite games. There's some connection issues though they're pretty temporary - and issues are addressed as quickly as possible. I trusted Remedy to provide a good experience, and the 2.5 hours I spent on it has told me all I need to know. That money is well-earned. If you care about money-to-time ratio, then maybe this game isn't for you, YET. But if you care about literally anything else as well, then I suggest you at least give it a shot. At the very least try it, with good intentions. You won't regret it. It's a damn good game. And it feels good to play. Me and a friend were really looking forward to this one. Came out of it with a reminder as to why I don't play triple A slop. Loved Control, but this was a huge disappointment. Played 2 matches; they were the exact same with zero variation. I admit that I only played for less than an hour, but it was enough. I am a simple man. I see Remedy, I invest. But all jokes aside. I wasn't really feeling this one, until it just clicked... after playing it with 3 randos online. It is a fun game, but it does get old quick, and intentionally so i believe. It does need some more content, but overall i am quite pleased with it. Give it a shot through gamepass or something if you are on the fence about it.

I am okay with this Con amigo goty, sin amigos no goty it hurts so good... Honestly I really enjoy this game. As much as i enjoy Elden Ring Night Reign has made a multiplayer that works a little differently than most multiplayer games out there which is exciting as games have become more copy and paste these days and dont manage to drag out enough play time before the boredom kicks in. Reasons I Enjoy NightReign: - Mechanics are nice and can be a little annoying if you're not used to them. Once you master movement and how to use like lock system it becomes much easier to play such as not locking on massive targets and such. - From what I've seen there is no macro purchases in the game, the game is based on purely how well you do such as unlocking different options like buying skins and extra rune classes after beating bosses. That is great because it makes you focus on the progression and you can show off your skins which are based on gameplay and not how much money you've spent on the game making it more of an accolade. - The farming system is genius , even if it is the same map at the moment. The map does change and on certain events, you have to learn when how to navigate different map changing events. I personally dont mind having the same map because it makes you learn how to path and farm the map more effciently depending on which side you start you want to approach your pathing differently. Especially when youre moving on after the first boss you'll need different relic classes and focusing on getting certain items for the specific boss' weakness that you are targeting. People need to get used to when to use the Hawk flight path and i feel like they would realise better pathing stategys. - Overall i think once people get the hang of the game and the community comes together to find optimal quick farming routes and easy to kill camps for fast clear. Its also fun learning how to navigate the events while making the quick witted decisions to be able to get the level you need so the boss isnt going to completely one shot you first attempt. Sure you may die not knowing the path of events and it might bust your run but then you learn for the next time and maybe not die to the gargoyle in lava running around the volcano event like i did twice in a row. Games are long but the game its self is fast pace, just remember keep up with your team. Dont stall to long there are more important things to kill than the random mobs in the field. My recommendation is get into the action, Know what camps you can kill fast, find that boss and grab your item. Farm Farm Farm Also if your solo and have a bad run i cant emphasise this enough... dont quit !!! Relics are important!!! might as well get to the boss and die and collect them. It gets easier with better relics, the right buffs on your main and a good idea of who you cant kill. If we can get more ways to communicate i feel like we would have a better solo experience with a duo and vice versa Happy farming and Good Hunting my fellow Maidenless Warriors.",2000000.0,5000000.0,3162277.6601683795
