"Honestly I really enjoy this game. 

As much as i enjoy Elden Ring

Night Reign has made a multiplayer that works a little differently than most multiplayer games out there which is exciting as games have become more copy and paste these days and dont manage to drag out enough play time before the boredom kicks in.

Reasons I Enjoy NightReign:

- Mechanics are nice and can be a little annoying if you're not used to them. Once you master movement and how to use like lock system it becomes much easier to  play such as not locking on massive targets and such.

- From what I've seen there is no macro purchases in the game, the game is based on purely how well you do such as unlocking different options like buying skins and extra rune classes after beating bosses. 

That is great because it makes you focus on the progression and you can show off your skins which are based on gameplay and not how much money you've spent on the game making it more of an accolade.

- The farming system is genius , even if it is the same map at the moment. The map does change and on certain events, you have to learn when & how to navigate different map changing events. I personally dont mind having the same map because it makes you learn how to path and farm the map more effciently depending on which side you start you want to approach your pathing differently. 

Especially when youre moving on after the first boss you'll need different relic classes and focusing on getting certain items for the specific boss' weakness that you are targeting. People need to get used to when to use the Hawk flight path and i feel like they would realise better pathing stategys.

- Overall i think once people get the hang of the game and the community comes together to find optimal quick farming routes and easy to kill camps for fast clear. Its also fun learning how to navigate the events while making the quick witted decisions to be able to get the level you need so the boss isnt going to completely one shot you first attempt. 

Sure you may die not knowing the path of events and it might bust your run but then you learn for the next time and maybe not die to the gargoyle in lava running around the volcano event like i did twice in a row.

Games are long but the game its self is fast pace, just remember keep up with your team. Dont stall to long there are more important things to kill than the random mobs in the field. 

My recommendation is get into the action, Know what camps you can kill fast, find that boss and grab your item. Farm Farm Farm

Also if your solo and have a bad run i cant emphasise this enough... dont quit !!!
Relics are important!!!
might as well get to the boss and die and collect them.

It gets easier with better relics, the right buffs on your main and a good idea of who you cant kill.

If we can get more ways to communicate i feel like we would have a better solo experience with a duo and vice versa

Happy farming and Good Hunting my fellow Maidenless Warriors.

"Na początku mojej przygody z Dying Light 2 skupiłem się głównie na szybkim przejściu fabuły, co – szczerze mówiąc – nie zrobiło na mnie dużego wrażenia. Gra wydawała się wtedy trochę nijaka. Jednak postanowiłem zacząć od nowa, tym razem skupiając się bardziej na eksploracji, misjach pobocznych i ogólnym klimacie świata. I to była świetna decyzja.

Z czasem gra naprawdę mnie wciągnęła. Klimat miasta, poczucie zagrożenia i chaosu – wszystko jest bardzo dobrze oddane. Mechanika walki jest świetna – brutalna, dynamiczna i satysfakcjonująca. Każda walka daje frajdę, zwłaszcza gdy nauczysz się wykorzystywać otoczenie i parkur.

A skoro już o tym mowa – parkur to temat, który budzi u mnie mieszane uczucia. Z jednej strony daje dużo swobody i radości z przemieszczania się po mieście, ale z drugiej – czasami działa, jak chce. Zdarzało się, że postać nie złapała się krawędzi, mimo że wyraźnie powinna, albo że nie mogłem zejść w dół po złapaniu się jakiejś krawędzi. Trochę frustrujące, ale da się przyzwyczaić.

W porównaniu do pierwszej części – Dying Light miało nieco inny klimat, bardziej surowy i mroczny, którego trochę mi tu brakuje. Mimo to, dwójka nadal trzyma wysoki poziom i oferuje masę dobrej zabawy.

Moja ocena: 8.5/10 – zdecydowanie warto zagrać, szczególnie jeśli lubisz połączenie parkuru, walki i klimatu postapo.",0.4,1750193279,True,534380
"To be fair, I'm early on. Still, I'll cover the very few let downs (for me), before singing the game's praises. 

I honestly hoped this continued Kyle Crane's story. I just got attached to that character, and was hoping for some sense of progression with the skills I had already gained from the first game. I didn't look into what this game was before I bought it, though. That said, Aiden is quickly growing on me.

The combat just doesn't feel as fluid as the first game. That will likely improve as I gain more skills, but this guy is supposed to be someone who's been a Pilgrim for years. That and the gene therapy he had (I'm assuming that's what it was), he should already be a bad@$$.

Now, the positives. I mean, where to start? The game is beautiful, run's smooth, and the story already has me hooked! I can see how the parkour and combat will become better with more skills and stats, even if it's a bit of a pain for now.

I love how the protagonists and characters are done in the Dying Light games! There's genuine personality and it feels more like how people would really act and speak in the world they are in. The side quests are fairly unique and satisfying, much like the Witcher. I'm also a fan of stealth being a factor in the game.

Honestly, despite the few things that felt like a temporary let down, I'd easily call this game a 9/10 for the type of game it is. It may be 10/10 by the time I finish :)

I do hope to try the coop at some point. I can see how this one is far better designed for an engaging coop experience, than the first one. Keeping in mind, the first one was still really good.

"I spent $525.20 on this game for gear, battle passes, and cosmetics, but it’s been a huge letdown.

PvP: From Decent to Disastrous

PvP started off okay, but recent updates have made it completely unbalanced. Pay-to-win mechanics dominate the game, with top PvP guilds purchasing the best gear. If you’re not spending, you don’t stand a chance.
Worse, all the top guilds are in alliances, turning PvP into an exclusive playground for a select few. This ruins the competitive spirit and alienates players who want a fair experience.

Lack of Content

As of June 2025, there’s no fresh content. The gameplay is repetitive, with a boring loop that lacks innovation. PvE is almost nonexistent, and the few available activities feel like an afterthought.

Rewards and Progression

The rewards system is underwhelming. Drop rates are abysmal, and the effort put into the grind doesn’t feel worth it. It’s a frustrating experience that kills any motivation to keep playing.

The game suffers from poor management, with hackers rampant in PvP. Lag switching and exploits are common, ruining the gameplay for honest players. These issues have driven many players away, leaving the game with a noticeably shrinking player base and low activity levels. This only adds to the frustration, as finding matches or engaging in cooperative activities becomes increasingly difficult.
It feels like no action is being taken to 
address these issues.

Final Verdict

This game had potential, but it’s now a shell of what it could have been. With poor balance, minimal content, pay-to-win mechanics, and lackluster rewards, it’s simply not worth your time or money.

"devs have essentially abandoned the game for aion 2 and have left it in a terrible state with no meaningful pvp, no meaningful pve, and horrible balance where the result of fights are determined by RNG (cc, evasion, heavy attacks). game has no catch up mechanics either so if you didn't play daily from day 1 you are permanently behind, and even the long time players that missed some dailies are still paying the price. 

there is still no queue-able battlegrounds PVP 6 months after the release of wargames, so I guess this game is for you if you wanna log in for dailies and 30 mins of ""PVP"" on some days",-0.3346153846153846,1750011096,False,2429640

"Hazır ilk Resident Evil incelememi yazıyorken, seriye nasıl adım attığımı da anlatayım dedim. Seriye başlangıcım Resident Evil Village ile olmadı. Benim ilk oynadığım Resident Evil oyunu Resident Evil 4 Remake’ti. Korku ögesi az, aksiyonu bol ama Resident Evil 5-6 gibi raydan çıkmamış bir oyun olduğundan seriye başlamak için güzel bir seçim olduğunu düşündüm. 4’ü bitirip o damak tadını aldıktan sonra soluğu 2 ve 3’ün remake versiyonlarında aldım. Ardından... bir duraksama. Çünkü TPS kamera açılı Resident Evil 2,3 ve 4'e katlanabilirdim ama FPS kamera açılı 7 ve Village, işte onu yapamazdım; en azından öyle sanıyordum.

Ama gün geldi, o eski korkak halime meydan okudum. “Ya bismillah” deyip 7’yi, ardından Village’ı indirdim. Şimdi de karşınızdayım; sizleri Village’ın hem gotik hem grotesk dünyasına, o ürkütücü köyüne, kalelerine, çürümüş labirentlerine davet ediyorum.

[h1]Hikaye ve Karakterler [/h1]
Hikaye bakımından Village, Resident Evil 7’ye göre çok daha kapsamlı. “Acaba şimdi ne olacak?” dedirten bir olay örgüsü var ve her adımı takip etmeye değer. Mekan tasarımları ve atmosfer de bu evreni fazlasıyla besliyor. Oyunun bazı kısımları RE4’ün o ikonik köy sahnelerini, bazıları ise RE7’nin klostrofobik gerilimini anımsatıyor. Özellikle dar koridorlarda bulmaca çözdüğümüz bölümler bana fazlasıyla RE7 havası verdi.

Karakter tarafında bu sefer daha fantastik ve karikatürize karakterlerle karşı karşıyayız. Lady Dimitrescu, Heisenberg gibi isimler, RE7’deki Baker ailesine kıyasla daha abartılı tiplemeler ama kesinlikle kötü yazılmış değiller. Ethan ise her zamanki gibi olaylara tam anlam veremese de yıkılmadan devam eden, sessiz ama inatçı bir karakter. Chris Redfield ile ilk tanışmam da bu oyuna denk geldi. Soğuk görünse de aslında içten içe iyi biri olduğunu hissediyorsunuz.

[h1]Oynanış [/h1]
Resident Evil Village’ın temel oynanışı RE7’ye oldukça benziyor ama bazı önemli farklılıkları var. Öncelikle vuruş hissi çok daha başarılı, özellikle animasyonlar sayesinde her silahın gücünü daha net hissediyorsunuz. Düşmanların bir kısmı hâlâ kurşun yutmaktan bıkmasa da, bu sefer tepki veriyorlar en azından.

Silah geliştirme sistemi, tüccar mekaniği ve loot hissi RE4 havası katıyor. Özellikle tüccar sistemi beni mutlu etti. Metroidvania benzeri ilerleme, yani ""şurada bir şey vardı ama açılmıyordu, şimdi geri dönüp bakayım"" tarzı sistem RE7’ye göre daha yoğun hissettiriliyor. Bazen bu durum biraz yorucu olabiliyor ama genel olarak işliyor.

Bulmacalar klasik RE ayarında: Ne çok zor ne de çocuk oyuncağı. Boss savaşlarına gelirsek; tasarımları oldukça iyi ama bazıları gereksiz uzun sürüyor. Cephane boşaltıyorum resmen ama yok boss hâlâ düşmüyor, resmen duvara ateş ediyormuş gibi hissediyorsun bir yerden sonra.

[h1]Teknik Detaylar [/h1]
Genel anlamda oyun stabil bir performans veriyor ama özellikle Lady Dimitrescu boss savaşında FPS’im yerlerde süründü. Bunun dışında ciddi bir problem yaşamadım. Grafikler RE7’ye göre daha bir tık ileri, atmosfer, ışıklandırma, çevre detayları oldukça etkileyici.

Eksik olarak ise FOV ayarı yok. Benim gibi dar kamera açılarından rahatsız olan biri için bu büyük eksiklik. RE7’de bu ayar varken burada olmaması tuhaf geldi açıkçası. Son olarak müziklere pek dikkat etmedim o yüzden pek bir yorumum yok.

[h1]Kapanış [/h1]
Resident Evil Village, korku ve aksiyonu iyi harmanlayan, atmosferiyle öne çıkan, hikayesiyle bağ kurduran bir yapım olmuş. RE7 kadar korkutmasa da yer yer gerçekten sağlam gerdi. FPS kamera açısına ve hayatta kalma korku türüne meraklıysanız ama nereden başlayacağınızı bilemiyorsanız; Village, sizi içine çekmeyi başaracak güzel bir başlangıç noktası olabilir.

"Hello, non-Steam War Thunder player here with 3,500 hours on file.
Pros: tanks look cool
Cons: Numerous and varied.
- The current server architecture is absolutely unstable at an inherently painful level. Movement issues, input lag, random server spikes across the board (that the entire server talks about in chat for 5 laggy, painful minutes), the ancient GHOST SHELL BUG, feature of multiple 'ITS FIXED!' reports (no it fucking isn't) and now a litany of stupid microjitters AND/OR invisible solid objects on maps which are just oh, so fun to drive into. Oh, and the lack of an Australian server (South Asia Ping? 180 if you're lucky. Packet loss? 10% minimum at peak times), but that's a personal peeve.

- Gaijin cannot possibly fathom the concept of gameplay innovation. If they'd instead consider the homeless man outside their offices, bashing away with a dustbin lid, this might change, because there are very, very few gamemodes actually populated beyond the basic 4; because those gamemodes outside the basic 4, fucking suck, because they're 'unpopulated' and 'nobody plays those, so why would we innovate on them and introduce fun new mechanics? Nah, add dozer blades to like a dozen tanks instead.' Those basic 4 are also extremely boring. Air Realistic is completely unplayable for bombers above 9.0, nullifying massive swathes of playable aircraft and relegating them to the bin, Ground Realistic is an exercise in not being hit by an exorbitantly bullshit projectile that violated several laws of the games' physics engine in order to save server performance and Arcade is effectively the only playable, enjoyable game mode - that doesn't give you enough progression to warrant playing it, because the length of time to grind above 5.0 is, funnily enough, reminiscent of a snail's pace.

- Predatory marketing taken to notable extremes. Do you want to progress in this game? Your time-to-grind will be more than halved with a Premium account. Premium account promotions are shovelled absolutely anywhere they can be. And it's fucking expensive, even OFF the Steam branch of this game (which incurs additional fees) the purchasable currency, advancements, premium account, etc etc, are all batshit insane expensive. Oh, AND, $120 AUD for a fucking F/A-18? Seriously? Or a Leopard 2A-whogivesafuck? Or a boat? $120? I shamefully admit I've thrown a disgusting amount of money at this game but I must admit, I regret those purchases and the support for this company resultant. No more.

I strongly advise against picking this up. Go elsewhere, like MTC4 on Roblox, or GHPC once it shows promise.",-0.1145959595959596,1749620252,False,236390

"I'm genuinely at a complete loss at these unhinged negative comments. This is a stellar game. Yes, you get 5-6 jobs, at different clearance levels and different difficulties. But there's a million unlockables that don't need ANY MTX, and the DLC is cosmetic only. Not to mention the different kits and weapons you can use to vary up the experience, and generally just the experience of grouping up with others, leading to a different dynamic.

You can also ping points of the map - so although there's no chat, you can still communicate. It's not a massive loss in my opinion - though I suppose it'd be nice in non-invite games.

There's some connection issues though they're pretty temporary - and issues are addressed as quickly as possible. I trusted Remedy to provide a good experience, and the 2.5 hours I spent on it has told me all I need to know. That money is well-earned.

If you care about money-to-time ratio, then maybe this game isn't for you, YET. But if you care about literally anything else as well, then I suggest you at least give it a shot. At the very least try it, with good intentions. You won't regret it.

"Black Desert can be fun, but has many issues with the game, most notably the gearing system.

 [Gearing]
While it has gotten better over the years, the enhancement process is still annoying with it's extremely low % chance of success and requires a TON of time sink to get the resources outside of events if you're not willing to wait for them.
It does give you plenty of easy gear to get as a beginner though from the seasonal rewards, so that's a plus. PS. Seasonal character is a must if you're new. Too good to not take advantage of.

[Combat/PvE]
The game's combat is really good when you get to higher levels and unlock awakening/succession, but some classes are still missing succession years later. You're going to be doing a LOT of grinding in this game. That's pretty much all the game is. Just tons of grinding mobs over and over or world bosses, getting mats or weapons to sell for big monies (Silver). The world bosses can be highlight moments for the PvE though. At least for me.

[PvP]
While unbalanced and chaotic, the PvP can be fun when it works. emphasis on WHEN it works. The introduction of a more balanced mode, The Arena of Solare, with equalized gear is more than welcome and a nice addition.
I do enjoy the PvP servers. Makes the grind zones more fun knowing there are other players around that are contesting the zones. It can lead to some funny rage moments from people getting killed.

[Lifeskill]
Oddly enough though, I found myself enjoying the games life skilling more than the combat.
From chopping trees to cooking food. It's got it all! Very chill experience.
I mostly fish in the oceans as my Shai. Manual fishing can be pretty fun.

[Graphics]
While it was impressive for it's time, I don't think the graphics of BDO has aged very well.
I had to look up a guide on how to make the game look better. By default it's extremely blurry and a mess. I couldn't even tell what was going on from how cluttered everything was.
The text on the UI being too small with no way to scale it in game (There is a way by adding a custom font into the game files). After fixing it it looks better, but still a little rough.

[Customization]
The character customization is also pretty good. from an in depth dyeing system to being able to edit each indivual part of your character's body. The only thing that holds it back in my opinion is that you pretty much NEED a value pack in order to access the dyeing system which is this games form of a subscription. No one sells the dyes on the player market.

Overall I'd say BDO is a great game to play and has many ways of enjoying it even with it's issues.

"I've played plenty of racing simulators, but iRacing is the best you can play nowadays. Yes, it's quite expensive because you have to buy each track and vehicle separately with real money, and you also pay a monthly subscription. But in this case, the price is justified. The tracks and vehicles are crafted down to the smallest detail. The sound design is top-notch. The physics are absolutely insane. Everything behaves just as I would expect it to in a real car. You can run into unexpected issues on track, from a punctured tire to an overheated engine. It's incredible how far the developers went with the details.

Originally, I just wanted to try iRacing out, but I didn't expect the simulator to be this polished — since then, I haven’t been able to put it down. It's absolutely unrivaled. If you enjoy racing simulators, you simply have to give this a try - the monthly subscription is totally worth it. There are even a few tracks and cars available for free, so all you need to do is pay for the subscription and you can see for yourself.

Hral jsem spousty zavodnich simulatoru, ale iRacing je to nejlepsi co si v dnesni dobe muzete zahrat. Ano, je to velmi financne narocne, protoze si kazdou trat i vozidlo musite koupit zvlast za realne penize a jeste platite za mesicni sub, ale v tomto pripade je cena opodstatnena. Trate i vozidla jsou propracovane do nejmensiho detailu. Zvuky jsou na spickove urovni. Fyzika je tady totalni masakr. Vse se chova tak jak bych ocekaval, ze se bude chovat v realnem voze. Na trati vas mohou potkat necekane komplikace od pichnute pneumatiky az po uvareny motor. Neuveritelne do jakych detailu vyvojari zasli. Puvodne jsem si chtel iRacing jen vyzkouset ale necekal jsem jak propracovyn tento simulator je a od te doby se od toho nemuzu odtrhnout. Naprosto bezkonkurencni. Kdo mate radi zavodni simulatory tak tohle proste musite zkusit - za ten mesicni sub to opravdu stoji. Je tam par trati i vozů zdarma takze jen staci zaplatit mesicni sub a nazor si udelate sami.",0.21147342995169086,1750154433,True,266410
"As good as iRacing may be, the subscription system, which requires you to buy all the cars and tracks, is a complete rip-off. The most ridiculous thing about the whole system is that even though I've bought various cars and tracks, I still can't use them offline after the subscription expires. I would understand if you couldn't race online without a subscription, but I would call it theft that I can't use the game and the content I purchased offline either. I'm not sure if this is even legal. This situation should urgently be investigated by experts.",0.03166666666666666,1750150410,False,266410

"The only way to know if you will like it is [b]by playing it yourself[/b]. But, I wanna ramble a bit so here's my review:

One of the best games I have played in my life. Finished it thrice on playstation (platinum) and once on PC (100% as well).

[h2]|The Story|[/h2]
[list]
[*]While a bit confusing, it's super unique, emotional and have a lot of moments that definitely stick with you. I'm not gonna say anything else about it, experience it yourself, don't watch trailers or anything.
[/list]

[h2]|The Gameplay|[/h2]
[list]
[*]The Good:
- The most important thing in my opinion, you [b]ALWAYS[/b] feel like that you are helping other players. All the time. The only connection that you have with other people is positive, you only interact with other players to help them or be helped by them. And the game gives you constant feedback in that regard with messages telling you how you are being useful to them.

- I personally find the gameplay loop to be super engaging (delivering packages). Playing on Very Hard and going everywhere by foot it's how I recommend playing it, at least the vast majority of the game. You will find the gameplay much more intense and entertaining. [spoiler]Vehicles[/spoiler] and [spoiler]roads[/spoiler] can make the game monotonous, so I advice using them sparingly (or not use them at all). I advice to not use any of the Director's Cut new items. They destroy the essence of the game.

- You have A LOT of collectibles, weapons and tools to discover, use, craft, etc.
 
- The ambience of this game is amazing. The overall vibe of it. It's just perfect. 


[*]The Bad:
- The [spoiler]driving[/spoiler] mechanics in this game are one of the most infuriating mechanics I had the disgrace to experience. They are just awful, there is not a single [spoiler]vehicle[/spoiler] made to be [spoiler]drived outside the roads[/spoiler], and yet you are forced in some orders (missions) to use them in a very complicated terrain. 

- The physics... 99% of the time I have failed an order, it was because of how the physics ""work"". I cannot explain them properly but anyone who has played the game knows how it feels to be walking down (SLOWLY) a slope and then the game detects the slope as some kind of massive cliff because you step on a small rock. Killing you and/or destroying your cargo in the process. (If this doesn't make any sense, it's because it doesn't make any sense. But it's how the game works.)

- [spoiler]You can't keep the tutorial outfit.[/spoiler]
[/list]

[h2]|Conclusion|[/h2]
[list]
[*]Those are the only things that annoys me. And I think those can be negative for both lovers and haters of the game so that's why I include them.
That said, the game is super fun and entertaining and I am so happy that games like this exist. 

It's not a game for everyone, but it was certainly for me.

1- a assinatura mensal é muito cara pelo o que oferece
2- a stamina do jogo (RP) recarrega muito devagar limitando muito a experiencia do jogador e portanto frustrante
3- sistemas de drops lendários escruciantes, ou praticamente nulos, semanas para conseguir um lendário enquanto outros jogadores com um toque de sorte acabam conseguindo varios deles em uma semana. Frustrante você tentar semanas a mesma coisas e nao ser minimamente recompensado. (Obs: nao quero drops faceis, mas baseado em seu esforço e nao em sorte, portanto após o player fazer varias vezes, deveria ser recompensado)
4- sim o jogo é pay to win mas para o final do jogo mesmo que gaste muito no jogo, nao irá progredir tanto.

"[h1] El GTA Más Grande de Rockstar Games [/h1]

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas fue un completo éxito cuando salió para la PS2 en el año 2004, un título que expandió completamente el horizonte de la franquicia, aclamado por la crítica hasta el día de hoy, siendo el GTA más grande la franquicia hasta ahora.

[h3] El Peak de la Saga [/h3]

Todo el mundo sabe que San Andreas tiene una muy buena historia, misiones y personajes, lo que me gustaría destacar es el trabajo que tiene de fondo éste Grand Theft Auto, tiene una cantidad de detalles inmensa, inmenso al igual que el tamaño y la diversidad del mapa, desde Los Santos, San Fierro, Las Venturas, etc. lamentablemente GTA San Andreas perdió bastante detalles posterior a su salida, lanzaron copias actualizadas y sobre todo en PC donde se notaba una leve diferencia de detalles comparándolo con la versión de PS2, sin embargo sigue impresionando por la cantidad de actividades y detalles que aún lo mantienen como el mejor GTA de la franquicia, demostrando que el juego que más vende no significa que sea mejor.

El mapa es súper explorable y divertido, está lleno de cosas para hacer, podemos ir al casino, misiones de vigilante, ambulancia, ir a ya saben dónde, hay muchos interiores explorables inclusive por mera decoración, además de poder ir a gimnasio, practicar artes marciales, tener novia y otras actividades menores que ambientan al juego. lo único negativo sobre el mapa es el hecho de que no se aprovechó demasiado las actividades dentro los espacios como el bosque, las dunas y demás, sin embargo es una ambientación muy diversa y disfrutable, llena de misterios y algunos Easter Eggs que todavía se conservan (aunque Rockstar eliminó muchos otros en ésta versión).

[h3] La Edición ""Definitiva"" [/h3]

Gráficamente está bastante bien aunque los personajes se siguen viendo de plástico y las sombras todas pixeleadas, algún que otro bug y muchos detalles/easter eggs que quitaron, la esencia del producto original persiste pero se nota cierto downgrade en los aspectos. luego está la optimización la cual está bastante dudable, tiene una caída de FPS pronunciada aunque se puede mantener semi estable por varios momentos. es cierto que de los 3 juegos éste fue el más trabajado de Rockstar debido al desastre que hizo Grove Street sobre los títulos, haciendo que terminen despedidos y que Rockstar Australia entre con las manos en el barro para intentar ""arreglar"" los juegos.

[h3] ¿Valdrá la pena revivir la nostalgia? [/h3]

Completamente, quizás ésta versión no sea perfecta, quizá carece de cosas que tenían las anteriores versiones de GTA San Andreas, sin embargo es una obra maestra que se conserva bastante bien en ésta versión, que mejoró el apartado gráfico y fuera de ésta versión es sin dudas el mejor juego de la franquicia.

"Elden Ring.
Mortal Shell’i saymazsam, ilk Souls deneyimim.
Öncelikle şunu söylemeliyim: Uzundu. Yer yer yorucuydu. Ama çoğu zaman heyecan verici; sonunda ise kesinlikle hayranlık uyandırıcıydı. Bir kere oyunda gözünüzün gördüğü her şey muazzam. Sanat tasarımı ve atmosferi inanılmaz başarılı.Uçsuz bucaksız ormanlardan ihtişamlı kalelere, karakterlerin ve silahların detaylı tasarımlarına kadar her şey adeta bir sanat eseri gibi.

Haritadan bahsetmem gerekirse, oyunun haritası inanılmaz büyük. Hem yatayda hem dikeyde keşfedilecek sayısız alan var. Mezarlıkların yapısı sık sık tekrara düşüyor ama bu, oyunun devasa yapısı göz önüne alındığında oldukça anlaşılır bir durum. Açık dünya yapısı sayesinde haritada özgürce dolaşabiliyorsunuz. Grace noktaları size bir yön gösteriyor, ama onu takip etmek zorunda değilsiniz. Bir bölgeye birden fazla yolla ulaşabiliyorsunuz ve çoğu zaman ilerleme sırasını sizin hareketleriniz belirliyor. Rastgele bir yerde, bambaşka diyarlara geçiş yapabiliyor olmanız ise oyun boyunca süren sürpriz faktörünü diri tutuyor.

Oynanış açısından da çok çeşitli imkanlar sunulmuş. Oyunda başlangıçta seçtiğiniz sınıfı, seviye atladıkça bambaşka bir yapıya dönüştürebilirsiniz. Ayrıca savaş sırasında ciddi katkı sağlayan Ruh Külleri, takabileceğiniz tılsımlar, fırlatılabilir potlar ve bıçaklar, kullanabileceğiniz büyüler ve silahlarınıza ekleyebileceğiniz Ash of War’larla birlikte, mutlaka kendinize uygun bir oynanış stili oluşturuyorsunuz.

Bosslarla ilgili şunu diyebilirim: Tasarımları, bulundukları mekanlar ve — takip edebildiğim kadarıyla — lore bağlantıları gerçekten şahane. Çoğunda zorlandım, bazılarını ise beklemediğim kadar kolay geçtim.
Ama biri var ki... malum.

[b]MALENIA[/b]
Blade of Miquella.

Oyun boyunca hiçbir şeyi özellikle değiştirme ihtiyacı hissetmemiştim.
Ama Malenia beni mahvetti.
Vuruşlarıyla can yenilemesi fikrini kim verdiyse… Sanki ikinci fazdaki çürüme yetmiyormuş gibi. Neyse.

İnternetten birkaç silah ve build araştırması yaptım, ama sonra çantamda gözüme farklı bir silah ilişti: Zehirli Sis ile kanlı hâle getirdiğim Çürük Savaş Çekici.
Onunla epik bir savaşa girdim ve muhtemelen 30 küsür ölümün ardından, bu build ile ikinci denememde sonunda başardım.
Verdim zehri, verdim kanamayı, verdim çürümeyi. 😄
Mimic Tear kullanmasam muhtemelen yine de onlarca saat sürerdi 😄

"Игра очень приятно удивила! Но если точнее - сначала немного напугала, капельку расстроила, минутку побесила, но спустя часа четыре раскрылась передо мной во всей своей красе! Реально, после FH4/5 я совсем не ждал, что какая-либо другая гоночная аркада сможет меня настолько увлечь.

Самое главное достоинство этой игры - это система тюнинга+стайлинга в сочетании с игровой физикой, что позволяет явно ощутить каждое изменение в автомобиле. На мой взгляд, в этом аспекте CarX вообще не уступает FH, и даже в чем-то превосходит (сам не верю, что пишу такое). Тюнинг у меня занимает где-то 40% всего игрового времени - очень увлекает. Это гигантское достоинство игры, из-за которого прощаешь ей множество недостатков...

Играю на геймпаде, с ручным переключением передач, без помощников, на максимальном уровне сложности. Всем советую, попробовать поиграть также. Игра совсем несложная. В плане вибро-отдачи, мне не очень нравится, после Форзы - там вибрация геймпада гораздо информативней. Еще мне неочень нравится вид от третьего лица - имею ввиду и положение камеры и ее резкие смещения за рулевым стиком - здесь разрабам снова стоило бы взять пример с Форзы. Ну и последнее мое замечание касается интерфейса (HUD) - слишком яркий и отвлекающий (видимо перекочевал из мобилок) - и снова желаю разрабам изучить пример Форзы.

Важное предостережение всем, кто только-только будет начинать пробовать играть в нее: Настройки по умолчанию интерфейса, управления и тп. мне показались просто отвратительными. Обязательно потратьте время, чтобы настроить все под себя!!! Настроек в игре совсем немного (даже меньше чем хотелось бы).

Сюжет тут, примерно, как и в Форзе - его почти нет. Ты просто гоняешь по локации, в поисках того, чем себя развлечь. Есть клубы уличных гонщиков, с которыми можно соревноваться, чтобы зарабатывать ресурсы на покупку и тюнинг автомобилей. Локации и графика в целом, выглядят скромней нежели в FH или NFS. Сетевой режим я пока что не пробовал - но позже обязательно попробую. Если замечу там что-нибудь примечательное для себя - вернусь позже и дополню отзыв.

Пока что игра нравится, потраченных денег не жаль! Любителям аркадных гонок можно смело пробовать! Разрабам желаю не забрасывать этот проект, а использовать его, чтобы прокачать скиллы для следующей части CarX. Когда выйдет - тоже куплю и поиграю!

"레데리2에 애정이 있다면 세일할 때 구매할 만한 게임.
그래픽은 15년전 게임임을 감안하더라도 나쁘지 않았고 최적화도 괜찮은 편. 
본편을 다 진행할 때까지 플레이에 방해가 될 정도의 버그는 없었음. 
스토리는 전반적으로 존 마스턴의 복수에 초점이 맞춰져있고 2편을 먼저 해본 유저들이 기대하는 반 더 린드 갱단원들과의 접점은 대부분 후반부에 쏠려있기에 초반 전개는 살짝 루즈한 감이 없잖아 있지만
존이 자신의 일 뿐만 아니라 시대상에 휘말리며 수단과 방법을 가리지 않고 나아가는 과정에 주목한다면 지루함은 조금 덜 수 있을 것 같음.  
갱의 서사도 1편에서는 그저 복수의 대상들이었기에 이야기가 조금은 빈약했다고 느낄 수도 있지만 역설적으로 2편이 얼마나 탄탄하고 좋은 이야기를 부여했는 지 알 수 있다. 
영화로 따지자면 1편은 스파게티 웨스턴, 2편은 뉴 웨스턴 느낌.
1편 역시 명작임에 틀림없지만 지금 다시 돌아보면  2편의 완성도를 더욱 부각시키는 역할을 하고 있는 듯하다.

Diplomacy and management are a bit too simplistic for me, but it isn't too important. The most important thing for me was the combat, which I enjoy. Multiple types of units, like light and heavy infantry, all with unique advantages and vulnerabilities, with even more unique differences between nations' soldiers of each type.

- อย่าหลงไปกับคำว่าต้องจ่ายเพื่อชนะ เกมนี้เราสามารถทดแทนการจ่ายเงินด้วยการเล่นได้ ทหารทุกกองทุกคนสามารถเข้าถึงได้ ไม่มีการจำกัดว่าต้องเติมเท่านั้นถึงจะสามารถนำมาเล่นได้ (มันมีไหม มีตัวที่เฉพาะต้องเติม แต่เอามาmemeมากกว่าเอามาเล่น พันกว่าชั่วโมงเคยเห็นอยู่ครั้งสองครั้ง)
- เกมมีการปรับเปลี่ยน ปรับบัพเนิร์ฟอยู่เสมอ ปรับสมบ้าง บ้งบ้างแต่เกมไม่ตายสนิท บางครั้งยูนิตที่นอกสายตาก็กลับมามีบทบาทจนฮอทในยุคของมัน
- ทหารเหมือนการเป่ายิงฉุบ ม้าแพ้หอก หอกแพ้โล่ โล่แพ้ม้า บลาๆ ทุกอย่างถ้าใช้ให้ถูกจุดเราก็สามารถทำประโยชน์ให้ทีมได้

ข้อเสีย

- แต่ละวันต้องการเวลาในการทำรายวันนานพอสมควร ต้องใช้เวลา1.5-2ชั่วโมง แล้วแต่ดวงว่าชนะ/แพ้แค่ไหน
- ทหารทุกหน่วยต้องการทำเควสเพื่อปลดล็อค บางเควสทำคนเดียวลำบากต้องหาปาร์ตี้ แต่ปัญหานี้แก้ไม่ยากด้วยการพิมพ์ในแชทโลก มีคนทำเควสเรื่อยๆ
- มือใหม่ช่วงแรกจะรู้สึกเสียเปรียบเล็กน้อยจากการที่ต้องตั้งตัวด้วยทรัพยากรที่มีจำกัดรวมถึงศักยภาพทหารพื้นฐานที่แจกมา แต่เมื่อผ่านเข้าสู่ช่วงตั้งตัวได้ปัญหานี้จะจางลงเรื่อยๆ วัดความอดทนของคุณ

VRChat ist ein ultra komisches VR Multiplayer Spiel. Alleine wie lustig die anderen Leute da rumhampeln mit ihrer VR Brille bringt einen oft zum Grölen. Das liegt auch daran, dass alle Körperteile des virtuellen Charakters dargestellt werden.
Eine lustige Runde Blödsinn während alle am Feuer sitzen ist echt chillig.
Die Grafik ist für ein kostenloses Spiel erstaunlich gut und die Mini-Spielchen machen zudem Spaß.
Man kann sich sogar in eine Art Kino setzen und YouTube videos zusammen schauen.
Leider kommt es manchmal vor, dass einige Spieler ihr Mikrofon viel zu laut eingestellt haben oder extra rumschreien, sodass man andere nicht mehr versteht. Hier sollte das Spiel evlt. automatisch runter- oder raufregeln.
Die Teleportation ist etwas ungewöhnlich, das man erst warten muss, bis der virtuelle Charakter ""vorausgegangen"" ist, danach erfolgt der Teleport. Einige Glitches sind vorhanden, manchmal steckt ein Charakter oder Gegenstand halb in der Wand.
Alles in allem aber eines der spaßigsten VR-Spiele im Multiplayer und es ist kostenlos!

"The inclusion of Metal Gear (1987) and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake (1990) in the Master Collection Vol. 1 offers players on Steam a rare and welcome opportunity to experience the origins of the stealth-action genre. These two MSX2 classics are more than just historical curiosities—they are the foundation upon which one of gaming’s most iconic sagas was built. And despite their age, they still carry surprising narrative and mechanical weight.

The original Metal Gear may feel rudimentary by today’s standards, but it introduced a revolutionary concept: stealth as a primary gameplay mechanic. Rather than encouraging direct confrontation, the game asked players to avoid enemies, manage limited resources, and think tactically. In an era dominated by run-and-gun gameplay, this was groundbreaking.

That said, the Steam version is a straight port of the MSX2 release, complete with its infamous limitations. The control scheme is stiff, enemy AI is simplistic, and there's a notable lack of in-game guidance, which may frustrate modern audiences. Yet, for those willing to look past these dated elements, the game still holds up as a fascinating piece of design history. It’s the prototype blueprint of what Metal Gear Solid would later perfect.

Metal Gear 2:Solid Snake is where the series truly found its voice. Mechanically, it’s a massive leap forward: enemies can now move across screens and detect sound, Snake can crawl and punch diagonally, and the level design feels far more intricate. The writing is also richer, offering shades of the philosophical themes Kojima would later become known for—war, loyalty, identity.

While still bound by 8-bit limitations, MG2 is a far more playable and compelling experience today. The structure resembles later Metal Gear Solid entries much more closely than you’d expect, and its cinematic ambitions are already taking form. If you can play only one of the two, Metal Gear 2 is the one that holds up best by modern standards.

The emulation quality is stable and faithful, though very barebones. There are no enhanced features, no modern conveniences like save states, and the resolution is locked to the original pixel scale. Players used to modern emulation suites might find the presentation underwhelming. However, the bundled manuals and digital extras (accessible from the launcher) help contextualize the experience, especially for new players.

As games, Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 are clearly products of their time—but their influence is undeniable. Nearly every game dev sim has mimicked their basic structure in some form, and their DNA runs through not just the Metal Gear franchise, but stealth games in general. Experiencing them today is like playing the Rosetta Stone of stealth gaming: flawed, fascinating, and essential.

Rating: 7/10 – Dated in form, foundational in spirit. A must-play for fans of game history or stealth genre origins—just be ready for some clunky design.",0.15363950565563464,1750158457,True,2131680
"Metal Gear 1 :

Recommend if you want to play the original game that is said to have launched the stealth game genre and live that retro game feeling of 80-90s. Recommend if you are willing to look up on the internet and follow up guides that will probably mean bollocks to you at first because you have long gone past the point that it makes sense! Recommend if you like self torture of backtracking tedious 80's pixelated levels to get the items that nobody knows that they are there except the devs themselves! (or the wizard people of old days who played this for countless hours and found those secrets themselves and wrote guides) I strongly suggest casual gamers to play the game only if you are willing to put through all of these. Following a guide from start will save you from lot of frustration, but if you are into self torture like me, look up only when you have tried first on your own and nothing comes up...",-0.034331955922865025,1750144833,True,2131680

"A good way to experience the very beginnings of a great series. The games, while having plenty of NES era BS, are incredibly innovative for the time, and so many of the mechanics just won't be found in games of a similar age. There's a fun arsenal of weapons to use, the pixel artwork is great, and the story is quite involved. As a remaster/port, it's pretty run of the mill, but it's still nice to have a new way to play the games.

My one suggestion for how to play this game if you do pick it up is to always have a guide on standby. Save yourself the frustrations from the more cryptic parts of the game, and just have fun admiring the achievements of the early days of the Metal Gear franchise.",0.3053977272727272,1750049438,True,2131680

"After Guild Wars 2, this is the best MMO for a solo player. Great graphics and excellent optimization. Combat is very satisfying, and hitboxes work perfectly, which makes every fight feel smooth and rewarding. Crafting is also very satisfying. This game doesn’t really have any major downsides if you’re a casual player and not even looking for an MMO, but rather a good RPG.

What I appreciate most is the lack of “Asian-style” influences. Maybe the side quests aren’t too ambitious, but the overall atmosphere of the game is fantastic.

Another big plus is the absence of aggressive microtransactions (even though they do exist). Still, having to pay for a mount as part of a DLC feels a bit over the top. But you can’t have everything. After around 50 hours, I did get a bit bored, but maybe that’s just because I play solo :) Either way, I highly recommend it.

"DONT get this if you have an okay PC like a all in one pc or an old pc. biggest regret of my life, for the first 1 hour 30 minutes it took me just to enter the game after so many crashes. Then when it finally worked it worked until i closed it, then worked ever since. Then after playing around 26 hours (5 hours wasted on entering the game it self) i have not played the game ever since, by gameplay i mean. Whenever i open it, it takes .1 of an hour to open then it would crash after i would enter a button to play. Its been now 38 hours and 17 hours of them were wasted on opening the game, and not being able to experience itself. I've wasted a lot of my money to play this game, and once it finally worked it was longer than the refund policy. I still have not been able to enter the game i think now for over a week. So DO NOT buy this game if you have an all in one pc or a pc thats 5 years old. I played all the games possible that required hyper graphics except for this one to be the first to give me problems.

"For anyone questioning whether to buy Arma reforger or not, I highly recommend you give it a chance.

Don't be discouraged by the control scheme or the mil-sim aspect, the game at its core is a sandbox with a bunch of fun toys to play with, and an amazing community to share the experience, this alone -the community- is one of if not the best aspects of the game, every game (and I mean every game) you get to laugh, roleplay, be tactical, or just goof around with chill and wholesome people, everyone seems to have a mic and 90% of the players you meet are mature and well mannered without any of the childish behavior or toxicity found in other games, heck I've found my self laughing and having very memorable moments with the enemy team very frequently.

the gameplay loop of vanilla reforger is pretty good, it's fun and it holds itself as a complete experience. However, modded reforger is where the magic happens. holy is the game made 10X better by the existence of these modded servers, each time you boot up the game you are spoiled for options of servers and game modes to choose from, and it's all integrated within the game, so no need to go on nexus mods or do any fancy installations to get it working, just choose a server and hop in.

there are some things to watch out for though: the performance certainly isn't the best, it's not the worst, but it isn't the best. there are a bunch of bugs present as well (most notable at the time of writing this review is the lighting bug and the grenade bug) which the dev team needs to address, which leeds to the other point, the dev team is slow and updates are infrequent and late almost always, this isn't that big of a deal since the modding scene does a lot of heavy lifting but still something to keep in mind. the game is also intimidating for new comers but the tutorial section does a really good job of easing you in.

All in all it's a great game and really worth the money, and there isn't much like it on the market (don't even dare pull the squad comparison) it's an experience worth having, and i'm sure you'll get hooked just like i did.",0.10735107284020327,1750191357,True,1874880

"*Обзор графония*
Движок Enfusion сразу бросается в глаза: улучшенная графика, детализированные ландшафты и реалистичное освещение делают мир живым и имерсивным. Остров выглядит потрясающе, а динамическая погода и смена времени суток добавляют глубины игровому процессу.  

*Геймплей и механики*
Reforger сохраняет фирменную сложность и реализм Arma, но при этом становится немного доступнее. Система управления и взаимодействия с окружением стала удобнее, а боевые механики — от стрельбы до вождения техники — проработаны на высоком уровне. Многопользовательские режимы, особенно Conflict, дают отличный опыт кооперативных и конкурентных сражений.  

*Моддинг и будущее*
Одна из сильных сторон — встроенные инструменты моддинга и поддержка пользовательского контента. Уже сейчас можно найти интересные моды, а с учетом платформы Workbench у игры огромный потенциал для роста.  

*Что можно улучшить*
Самая главная проблема это доступность серверов и стабильное соединение с мастерской.
Также хотелось бы больше миссий и официальных сценариев.  

*Итог*
Arma Reforger — это отличный фундамент для будущего серии. Если вы любите тактические шутеры с глубоким геймплеем и реализмом, эта игра определенно заслуживает внимания. С нетерпением жду, во что она превратится с выходом Arma 4!

While it is a live service title it respects the player enough that it doesn't feel like one, but rather like a singleplayer game with online features that is constantly updated. Like an Ubisoft game but better because it's more grounded in reality.

"Oyunun chapter 1 ve chapter 2 aşamalarını %100 oynayıp bitirdim ve bazı hem eleştiri hem de fikirler elde edindim, 1. chapter ile ilgili sıkıntılar mevcut bunlar klasik erken erişim problemleri fakat üstesinden kesinlikle çok rahat gelinebilir. Bazı ses hataları var, görsel yırtılmalar ve fps droplar hissediliyor oynanış açısından combat mekaniği videolarda gördüğüme nazaran daha iyi ama daha da iyi olabilir atak yaparken bazen vurduğum karakterler arasında kaybolma sorunu yaşadım. 2.Chapter ile ilgili fikirlerim tamamen olumlu, görsel açıdan 1. aşamaya göre aşırı iyi oynanış mekanikleri de ekleniyor. Karakterler arasındaki geçişler ve hikayeleri birleştirme çalışmaları çok güzel. Hikayeyi yansıtma açısını çok beğendim yine bir kaç sorun var ama düzeltilecek ufak hatalar.

Sin dudas no sere popular por decirlo, pero me decepciono.

No en el apartado grafico, o la jugabilidad. Eso ya estaba bien en el primero. Y aca sigue igual.

El problema es la historia. The Last Of Us 1 simplemente es perfecta, es una historia repleta de drama, y hace pensar sobre la vida. Tan es asi que me compre libros sobre el juego.

Tenia mucha expectativa respecto al Segundo. Pero que me encuentro, una historia que arruina a Ellie, llevandola a lugares de lesbianismo y drogas que nada tienen que ver con la historia. 

Sin dudas los desarrolladores quieren meter un poco de Woke... pero para que volverla lesbiana y drogona. Eso no me aporta nada, y al contrario hace que el concepto general del juego deje de ser influenciar, y pase a ser simplemente quedar bien con los tiempos actuales. Sin dudas una pena.

"Had to refund it very fast....
------THE PROS: 
 The ideea is good, procedures are cool, tools, steps you must do...
Some legal some less.... what people do... 
You can sell cars fairlyt easy. Town is small, you can fix stuff, pretty hands on untill you can hire staff.
Cars list is not THAT variable but there are cool cars to  fun, relaxing (to a point) 
You need to bee on the edge for vandals not to mess up the cars beeing sold.
Can buy car parts swap/fix them yourself

----CONS 
Now, here the list is waaay to long...and i havent played alot 
The handling is horrible, like cartboard cars, suspension doesnt exist, brakes , steering lifeless, bugs all the way, lag , FPS drops, SYS REQ is idiotic for what it is , zero  optimization what so ever. 
follow EVERY HINT and read it, if you dont its quite hard to find some tools and protocols how to do.
Some jobs didnt finish , despite beeing done 
Fixing and how to fix ,  vaguely explained
Getting stuck on obstacles with car is way to easy 
All cars have the same dash.........?????( the ones i sold had the same and the truck)
Game becomes repetitive but there is stuff to do. 
NOT worth the price, less than half should be the real price for it. 

OVERALL: 
It could be a good game with good ideas, there are fun things to do but executed horribly... 
Hope they will fix it and adjust things in it, mainly car handling, i mean make them SOME
I refunded it, i get it with a big discount...maybe if^^^

Rating: ★★★★☆ (4.5/5) (つ╥﹏╥)つ

Raft is one of those survival games that quietly pulls you in. You start floating on a tiny wooden platform with nothing but a hook, and before you know it, you’ve built a full-on floating mansion. The gameplay is super satisfying — collecting debris, expanding your raft, fighting off a Bruce, and exploring islands all feel rewarding.

Playing with friends makes it even better. 

It’s not perfect — solo can feel a bit grindy and late-game organizing gets messy — but overall, Raft is a creative, relaxing, and sometimes intense survival experience that’s totally worth diving into.

"1) The game is hard even on Casual. You're facing a group of regular enemies (and they may be hard to kill, already), and out of nowhere, a boss comes. Or you're facing a boss and several enemies come out of nowhere and kill you with only 3 hits or less

2) No fast travel/teleport. The closer you have to it are oxcarts

3) The graphics in this game aren't that good, but you still need a very good PC

4) The Pawn can't revive each other. It's all on the hands of the player and the Pawns can't use healing items, either

"Dragon's Dogma 2 is almost a banger. It's genuinely a performance patch and a little more structure (or a little less) away from being a modern classic. It has one of the most interesting systems I've seen for companions in the form of pawns, a very cool if slightly slow combat system that's flashy but not ridiculously so, and a beautiful world that's just a joy to be present in. Many times I stopped to admire the scenery, and every now and then something genuinely cool would happen in combat that made me stop to process what just happened. It has a level of immersion during exploration I've been desperate for in a fantasy rpg for years. All sounds great right? Big old but incoming.

In spite of all of that, it has several very notable flaws. For starters, this game needed way more support, additional content particularly in the post game would have been extremely beneficial. In spite of everything, the game is a mile wide and an inch deep. The procedural physics and dynamic interactions between enemies and allies in combat are very fun to toy around with, until you realize the joke where you tossed the poor goblin stupid enough to exist in your presence off a cliff is the easiest way to deal with 90% of enemies, and the other 10% are cool set pieces with way too much health that really only have that wow factor the first few times and then become a slog. It's cute when your pawn returns with news of a ""strange arisen who only hired women"", start mimicking your cliff based combat tactics, and then show you where they encountered a chest with them, but that also becomes repetitive and loses it's wow factor overtime. Quests are in short supply, and many of them boil down to ""walk here, talk to this guy, kill that thing"" with a few escort/tailing missions every now and then.

With that said, there's a reason I have as many hours in this game as I do. Underneath the thin veneer of slick combat and personalized interaction is a heap of flaws and strangely aimless experience, but if you dig a little deeper there really is something special here, and if Capcom ever decides to start supporting this game again it really can be something special. Until that happens, it's a decent way to kill time if it's ever on sale. Overall, solid 7/10.",0.06824206349206345,1750184061,True,2054970

L'excuse ne tient pas la route : la chute de l’audience francophone s’explique principalement par la forte concurrence des nouveaux jeux, mais aussi par le manque de visibilité des nouveaux contenus (DLC) depuis 2022.

Même de nombreux jeux mobiles proposent des traductions automatiques, parfois basiques, mais qui permettent au moins de suivre l’histoire.

Tenia mucha expectativa respecto al Segundo. Pero que me encuentro, una historia que arruina a Ellie, llevandola a lugares de lesbianismo y drogas que nada tienen que ver con la historia. 

Sin dudas los desarrolladores quieren meter un poco de Woke... pero para que volverla lesbiana y drogona. Eso no me aporta nada, y al contrario hace que el concepto general del juego deje de ser influenciar, y pase a ser simplemente quedar bien con los tiempos actuales. Sin dudas una pena.

"I specifically bought it because it was listed as Steam Deck Verified – but the experience, especially the controls, was absolutely terrible. Man, I really, really wanted to like this game, but unfortunately, after trying for hours, the poor controls made it one of the worst experiences I’ve had in a while – despite its nice graphics, theme, and overall style.

I tried configuring the controller, used some of the templates, tried it with an Xbox controller while streaming on TV – it’s just a pain. I really don’t get why the recommended layout doesn’t make use of the more available buttons on the Steam Deck in the first place.

Also, who approved “In-game interface text is legible on Steam Deck”? For me, it’s tiny – and scaling the UI makes the whole screen covered in massive text boxes.

It’s very disappointing, and I honestly can’t understand how it received official Steam Deck verification – or how it’s considered playable on any console, really.

"I’ve got like 2k hours in COH2 and played a ridiculous amount of COH1 back in the day — like, back when CDs were a thing. Me and my friends used to lose our minds trying to set up COH LAN parties, spending hours troubleshooting random bullshit, people dropping out of games left and right. Anyone who glorifies COH1 and complains about bugs in the newer games probably forgot or doesn’t understand how much of a clusterfuck that game used to be.

I held off on COH3 for a while. The price was just too high considering how much of a mess it was at launch, and I wanted to give the devs time to iron out some of the issues — same way COH2 had its problems when it first came out. I’ve got a few hours into COH3 now. Still not 100% caught up on every game mechanic, but honestly? Other than the UI being kinda weird and the art style feeling inconsistent at times, the core mechanics seem solid so far. The bullet physics are cool, I really like the auto-reinforce system, not needing to send engineers back to expand your base is nice, and being able to hook/unhook heavy weapons is a great addition.

I didn’t play much single player in COH1 or 2 and probably won’t in COH3 either — I’m more into skirmishes and multiplayer PvP. From the few 3v3s and 4v4s I’ve played, the balance seems decent, and I’ve had fun. I was definitely a little worried about buying it with the mixed reviews, but I kinda figured that after a few solid updates things would be in a good spot, and honestly, they are.

The art for unit illustrations is definitely subpar compared to earlier games, and some of the UI icons look like they just grabbed low-res screenshots from the old games and slapped them in. Just pay a proper artist to clean that up and make it all feel more polished and cohesive. But I can live with it, because the core game isn’t bad at all. I really hope the devs keep working on it — I feel like the combat and mechanics are way better than what COH1 and 2 used to be.

"After spending over 250 hours in Cities: Skylines II, I feel confident saying this: it’s a game that’s both frustrating and fantastic, often at the same time.

👍 What I Loved:
Deeper Simulation: Every citizen truly has a life. The way cims choose jobs, commute, and move between cities feels more alive than ever before.

Zoning & Infrastructure Tools: Road tools, snapping options, and freedom of city planning are far more flexible. It's easier to build beautiful, realistic cities.

Service System Overhaul: Police, fire, garbage, and health are more nuanced and realistic. Managing city services feels like managing a living, breathing system.

Weather & Seasons: Adds a fresh layer of immersion. Snowfall, rain, fog — it’s all stunning.

Modding Potential: While it's still in development, the base has been laid out well for creators to eventually transform this game like they did with CS1.

👎 What Needs Serious Work:
Performance Issues: Even after updates, the game still suffers from stutters, FPS drops, and long load times, especially on large cities. Optimization is far from perfect.

UI/UX Clutter: Certain menus feel bloated or unintuitive. Accessing crucial info sometimes takes more clicks than it should.

Lacking Polish: Bugs, pathfinding issues, and simulation oddities occasionally break immersion.

Missing Features (from CS1): Some features and DLC-quality content from the original are still missing here — understandably, but noticeable.

🧠 Final Thoughts:
Cities: Skylines II is not a casual sequel. It tries to evolve city-building in a more realistic, detailed direction, and for that, I respect it. But it launched rough and still feels like a work-in-progress.

That said, if you're passionate about city building and willing to push through its rough edges, this game can easily consume hundreds of hours — just like it did for me.",0.1192857142857143,1750185258,True,949230

В последнее время этих ""симуляторов"" как говна расплодились. начиная с 2023 года и по сегодняшние дни бездарные разработчики клипают третесортное говно, с одинаковой графикой, ужаснейшей оптимизацией, одними и теми же багами за дикий оверпрайс. меня достало, что мой любимый жанр ставят на конвеер, приправляя это мультиплеером. и это вина тех, кто продолжает это покупать и жрать говно в 30фпс. подобная какафония уже была с мобильными играми, где студии по типу voodoo пилили чуть ли не по несколько игр за месяц, там были все вышеописанные проблемы, только еще и куча рекламы, ведь на мобилки игры никто покупать не будет. я очень надеюсь, что скоро спрос на эти ""игры"" упадет до нуля и все горе программисты пойдут дворы мести, как они делали до всего этого цирка уродов. Лучше бы вместо клипания однообразного говна из года в год, сделали бы нормальный симулятор и поддерживали его годами, как это делают те же scs softgaming(но даже они из за отсутствия конкуренции особо не потеют).

"Non è un brutto gioco, non posso dargli pollice verso, ma guardare la mappa dopo venti ore e vedere che resta da svelarne ancora molto, ma molto più della metà, svilisce e fa tremare le gambe, specialmente se il sistema di gioco inizia pesantemente a venire a noia.
Se con Origin la serie aveva avuto un'evoluzione interessante, merito soprattutto dell'intreccio e dei personaggi raccontati, in Odissey il tutto viene diluito in un titolo gargantuesco e dalla mappa sconfinata, dalle infinite attività secondarie e dallla perenne sensazione che meno sarebbe stato meglio.
Non mi sento di giudicare male l'abbondanza, ma mi dispiace che per il capitolo ambientato nella Grecia antica, un'ambientazione che adoro molto più dell'Egitto di Origin, la mia attenzione non abbia retto fino ai titoli di coda, affossata da un'impalcatura di gioco che non è in grado di reggere tutta questa vastità.
Resta, in ogni caso, una rappresentazione splendida della Grecia e delle sue isole, adatto soltanto a tutti quei giocatori che non avranno paura di chiudersi per centinaia di ore nel medesimo mondo, purtroppo a ripetere sempre le stesse azioni.

Cheers...ai greci biricchini.",0.0,1750188966,True,812140

"Excelente juego de fantasía oscura en primera persona. Si bien no inventa nada nuevo y deja bastante claros cuáles son sus referentes, vayamos por partes con lo que más me ha gustado:

La jugabilidad recuerda mucho a títulos como The Elder Scrolls, pero con un giro interesante: el simple hecho de añadir un dash y mecánicas de parry lo vuelve mucho más dinámico y entretenido. 

El apartado artístico es simplemente sublime. Los paisajes, el diseño de entornos y personajes, el equipo... Todo está impregnado de alma y ese toque oscuro y decadente que (personalmente) me fascina. No hay un solo rincón que no transmita esa atmósfera.

La banda sonora es potente, con varios temas memorables que brillan en momentos clave. 

Y el mayor punto fuerte: la trama. Oscura, compleja y absorbente desde el primer momento. Es cierto que decae un poco en el segundo y tercer acto, pero eso no empaña el conjunto. La historia principal mantiene el interés hasta el final. Mención especial a las misiones secundarias: algunas están a la altura de las mejores de Divinity: Original Sin II o The Witcher 3. No es poca cosa.

Ahora, lo que menos me ha gustado:

A nivel técnico, el juego muestra sus costuras. No hablo tanto del apartado gráfico —que, aunque modesto, es bonito y funcional— sino de problemas más serios: popping muy visible, caídas de rendimiento en ciertas zonas, tirones, errores visuales… Por ejemplo, hay áreas enteras que no pasan de los 50 FPS a pesar de que la CPU va sobrada. Confío en que muchos de estos fallos se corrijan en futuros parches.

La animación del caballo es rara y poco fluida. Da la sensación de que la mecánica se implementó deprisa y sin mucho cariño. Además, el mundo no te empuja a usarlo: caminar es más cómodo.

Lo mismo ocurre con la vista en tercera persona. Entiendo que se añadió por petición de la comunidad o como medida de accesibilidad, pero sinceramente… no era necesario. No se ve bien, no se controla bien, no se siente bien. Parece un mod, y uno no muy bien integrado.

A pesar de estos fallos aquí y allá, Awaken Realms ha creado un universo fascinante al que me encantaría volver. Questline ha hecho un trabajo sólido con los recursos que tenía y ha sabido dar vida a una fantasía oscura rica en detalles y alma.

Si te gustan los RPG de la vieja escuela, donde cada decisión importa y puedes perderte en un mundo abierto lleno de secretos… si disfrutas de las ambientaciones densas y sombrías… y si, como un servidor, eres fan del mito artúrico, Camelot y los caballeros de la mesa redonda, no se que esperas a jugarlo.

"Quickly becomes boring in the middle of Act 2 - everything is the same, enemy AI is poor and basic - even bosses are copies of each other.
A lot of bugs - key NPCs for quests can disappear, sometimes you cant interact with objects, quite often you can move through textures, some quest events can crash the game...
Last Act 3 - just joke - instead of grand city and finale - we have 4 villages with a lot of boring quests.
I believe devs should release full game a bit later, cuz right now game looks unfinished and raw",-0.13815120065120065,1750192676,False,1466060
"Tainted grail is REALLY good and fills that missing elder scrolls niche for the first two acts of the game, very dense, good dungeon design, fun combat for every style, nice skill trees, tons of unique magic items and spells, looks good, a few lovely characters, just a very very dense well made game
then you get to the final area and it becomes extraordinarily clear that the game isn't finished. Missing geometry, bugged quests, major characters with no voice acting suddenly, no rewards from dungeons, major faction questlines ending with a very weak binary choice that affects nothing and no rewards, quests that by their description should have some complex or nuanced solutions that just summon an enemy and you kill it (for no reward), less quests in general, areas and characters just showing their filenames (Scene/Ending_AlchemistDungeon_Final). things like that everywhere. 
While its understandable for a dev to have to rush a game out the door due to deadlines and investors being demons in human skin this one REALLY needed to cook for another few months to a year and just have act 3 release later. 
Great game up until then though, I hope the devs fix it so it lives up to its potential and ambition.",0.06891203703703702,1750191980,False,1466060
