"I think this game would be more popular without the big change they did to the way of play of the game. The remastered storyline is trash with 10 euro budget cutscenes, the artistic explanation cutscenes are the only ""manageable"" thing. Morning light is trash with people having the same face forms everywhere. not even the hair or beard was changed between npcs having the same face. dogshit cutscenes with low effort connecting storylines. just meshed up garbage thought of in a days basis. whoever brought the idea up to change the game completely with 0 intention to make it good. But only to haul a good load of money if only for a little time for the little they invested in this game for it. absolutely cursed, Making the whole game easy, giving new players everything, lowering the requirements of destroyed enemies to complete a mission from the storyline by almost 100%, Denying to add fast travel for so long to keep the game as immersive as it was. then completely destroying the immersiveness by trying to boost money numbers from the game with again 0 intention to make it better not to mention you cant sit normally on your horse when sprinting. instead you float in the sky and these dumb animals decided to only fix that bug for dosa with the rest of my characters still having that garbage bug for so long.

"Almost a great game.
My impression --> The game is quite fun and interesting probably the better of the triage of Wargaming.net games. However, up to level 5 ships can be researched and bought through the players normal grind. At level 6 and above unless you've purchased a DLC that contains a ship above level 5 the game loses its pull for me. Level 6+ ships require Doubloons that never drop and can only be bought. All the fancy ships require currencies that are impossible to acquire without purchasing in-game items. If you don't mind playing below level 6 with the exception of DLC's you will actually enjoy the battles.  Doubloons are the major in-game currency and the caveat being that unless doubloons start dropping the paywall truly separates further progression in play unless you're willing to fork out some serious cash for the really boss ships they offer by buying the in-game currencies.",0.03486842105263157,1752448003,True,552990

- Hackers are starting to appear in-game more frequent
- No report system for any sort of out of conduct behaviour
- Their priority is the store rather than fixing essential issues

Sad tbh, had a blast with the game in beta, and the gameplay loop is addicting, but as it stands it causes more frustration now than fun.

"Definately one of the top DLC for this game. I’d say this and Biotech are the two that add the most to the experience. The grav ship in particular opens up so many new and interesting playstyles.
It also integrates rather well with the other DLCs.

This is how my first game is going so far:
I started with three pawns getting dropped naked and without supplies into a boreal forest.
They were criminal raiders (ideology DLC) exiled to this rimworld as punishment for their crimes.

In the beginning it was just like many other games I’ve played before.
My pawn rushed to make shelter and raise some crops before the winter.
Creating clothes and weapons was also a high priority.
We even helped out the local fallen empire save one of their people and got some valuable psy-powers for our leader as thanks (royalty DLC).

And then the grav-engine and a ton of ship materials dropped into the colony from orbit (odyssey DLC). It crushed part of the base, but that was fine. The pirate life was calling.

My exiled criminals started building a ship frame around the engine during the winter, while simultaneously fending of enemy raids and hunting and fishing for food. They also went on a few raids themselves to get food and materials for their own survival. We also saved a Dirtmole and Neanderthal (biotech DLC) from captivity and added them to our crew. Their skills helped a lot in making up for the shortcomings of the original trio.

Building of the ship continued well into the next year. By the time everything was ready the ships fridge was well stocked with corn, rice and meat. Well supplied with resources my pawns started their first grav-ship journey. Toward a nearby underground shelter supposedly filled with precious materials to expand the ship even more.

By now we had a whole crew of six so expansion of the ship was vital. So we scavenged the ruins, lost an arm and a leg to explosive mines, almost died to metal horrors that a new recruit brought aboard unknowingly (anomaly DLC), and made our ship bigger and better.

After that we settled into a fun and comfortable rhythm. Grab ship materials from a dangerous location, move to a tile with fertile ground to do some farming and raiding of the neighbors. Expand the grav ship to accommodate new crew and facilities. Go to the next dangerous place with ship materials, repeat.

This gameplay loop is incredible fun as you slowly but surely build and expand your ship, which acts like your mobile base. I am excited to see how the story of my pirate crew will continue.

I haven’t even gotten to the new options for raising animals or orbital exploration and living.
There is still so much to discover. I am loving this experience.

Definitely a thumbs up from me.",0.12574592074592078,1752650374,True,3022790

"The current state of the endgame is far too barren, the PvP is horrendously unbalanced and broken, the deep desert is full of people duping items, exploiting bugs, and hacking. The current state of the endgame makes the buildup to it feel like wasted effort.

What's worse is that while the devs claim to be making PvE more available by increasing the area flagged as PvE in the endgame area, the amount of resources has been halved and the respawn timer on those resource nodes has almost doubled from 25 minutes to 45 minutes. 

So an entire server cluster of potentially hundreds of people have to fight over 20 nodes that spawn every 45 minutes and yield so few resources you would need get ALL 20 nodes EVERY respawn for days straight to have enough resources to make both the endgame items and crafting stations needed to make them.

I don't mind PvP but it's more forced than ever, and just as broken and unbalanced as it was at the start, if not moreso.

"It's probably some of the best writing we've seen from Destiny. The new characters don't feel like just another expansion vendor flavor of the year"", they've actually got nuance and soul to them. I actually care about Lodi's story and his new role, I want to see where Orin goes now that she's free, and I'm stoked about the massive plot hook they drop at the end of the campaign. ""It's boring"" people are the kind who skip cutscenes and don't do the 15 seconds of 3rd grade level reading needed to pick up the most basic understanding of the story, because this one is a banger.

I get that the new matterspark mechanic isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I enjoyed it. It's the most different thing we've seen from Destiny.... ever, maybe? I dunno, the game needs risky innovation like this if it wants to survive. Another year of just ""more Destiny 2"" is asking for mediocrity and a dead game, so I like that Bungie is taking that risk to try something really off-the-wall. 

My only criticisms would be encounter design and biome monotony. Every encounter basically followed the same ""dps boss until you reach the health gate, then do a lil mechanic to drop their shield, repeat"" that we've seen for long time. It would have been nice to see some variety in how we interact with boss HP, even if the mechanics to get to the damage phase did *technically* change. On the note of the biomes, it felt like we were just on Mars-flavored Io with fungus the entire expac. It would have been nice to have a little more variety in how the place looked, but I also understand that environments are expensive as hell.... but then I also remember that Sony bought Bungo for like 4bil, so maybe they can afford it? idk.

The new enemy types were nice, though. Very well integrated into the rest of the roster. Also they're calling me ""Weapon"" now? That's fuckin sick, 10/10.",0.10253159003159004,1752651816,True,3186490

"I've been playing the game since last year, few months last year and a few now. I had ESO Plus, because it is really tiring and a gatekeeper to other stuff in the game if you don't have it.

I was most focused in PvE content, solo content. To people who likes to stay in the story side in a RPG, it is a great game, you can solo content easily, even if you're not strong, and that was my case because since the beggining I had a tank char, so I couldn't do considerable damage. But to enjoy everything plus is necessary, of course.

But is a OLD GAME, and the main problem of old online games to me is the players who ""live for the game"", who take it like the most important thing in theirs lives, and make a hell in your life if you're not in the level, the class, the abilities, they want to. It's a TERRIBLE game with a TOXIC community when it comes to online content.

ESO, like other games that have online content with roles, have sooooo few players playing tank and healer. You can wait minutes to hour in a line to play a online content.

And I chosed to be a tank because of that, to join my friends in some contents (dungeons).

And being a tank or a healer IN A WAY that the toxic players like, it's so demanding, and frustrating, THEY DO NOT have patience if you're a new player.

I decided to stop playing the game, because i tried my best, i waited to be in a mid-higher level, +500CP, and have a FULL BUILD, that took me months to farm, so I could be useful and don't receive a bad treatment. But with few trials (12 people content), the toxic players ended all my joy to play this game. I was new to trials, I did a mistake in one, because i did not know the mechanics, and I reicived messages calling me names, threating me, telling me to end my life, in the wort ways possible.

A lot of players in this game are bad with new players, and treat them like trash just because they don't know something. WHAT DON'T MAKE SENSE, because if you're new, u will not know.

And the worse to me, ibeing a game YOU PAY, because without pass it's frustrating to play this game, so it's a MMORPG you pay monthy, the ZeniMax don't take actions to solve the toxicity of the comunity. I'm telling my case here, but all my friends suffered the same in some point with online content.

So, if you want to play this game, be aware people there are becoming more and more toxic.

Кроме того здесь присутствует элементы хоррора, что в моём вкусе. И честно говоря игра начала меня затягивать только после первых двух трети игры. Что конечно слабенько.

虽然还没通关，但这游戏对叙事节奏的完美把握让我玩起来欲罢不能。相较于mimimi的游戏而言，本作对潜行的设计比较轻量化，也弱化了冲突，更侧重解谜，不同角色功能之间的搭配给人感觉很适合做成多人联机模式（虽然我是个独狼玩家）。这种过场CG精致且重剧情的RTT确实不多见，玩起来是一种很新鲜的体验。不过听说总流程只有十小时，太短了，显得这个定价太高，希望开发商后续能增加一些玩法内容吧。,0.0,1752687610,True,2377280

"20 saatlik keyiften, Blizzard’a tüm kalbimle s*ktir çekmeye…

Oyunda zerre sıkıntı yoktu. Biraderimle birlikte oynamaya başladık, 20 saat su gibi aktı geçti. Ta ki bir gün sonra oyuna girmeye çalışırken 522 kodlu hatayı alıncaya kadar. Başta geçici bir sunucu hatası sandım, ama aynı anda e-mailime bir bildirim düştü. Blizzard’dan gelen mailde Battle.net hesabımın süresiz olarak banlandığı yazıyordu.

Şaka gibi. Ulan daha 20 saatim var oyunda, ne hilesi? Bot desen yok, glitch abuse desen o da yok. Sktir boktan ToS’lerinden dolayı ban sebebini de açıklamıyorlar. “Topluluk kuralları ihlali” deyip geçiyorlar. (Skimi emin oeları.) Hesabı kapatıyorlar ama nedenini bildirme gereği duymuyorlar.

Maili görmemle birlikte Blizzard desteğine ticket attım. Türkçe destek zaten yok, destek sayfasındaki yazılar bile Google Translate ile çevrilmiş gibi. Tamam, İngilizce ticket atmak sorun değil, onu geçtim. Ama gel gelelim, ticket’ıma hala cevap veren yok. En kötü bir otomatik dönüş olur, incelemede dersin, bir şey dersin. Hiçbir şey yok, taş gibi suskunlar anasını sktklerim.

Eğer bu kadar bahtsızsanız ve aynı zamanda benim kadar sabırsızsanız şunu bilin: GM’lerin gooning challenge yaptığı için günlerce cevap alamazsınız. Oyunun parasını verirken iyiler, ama iş desteğe geldi mi ortada yoklar.

Uğraşmayın. Oyunu silin, Blizzard’a her yerden sövün. Tek yapabildiğim bu oldu zaten.

"Jogo extremamente mal desenvolvido. A definição de dificuldade para os desenvolvedores é simplesmente encher de inimigo no mapa, fazendo com que seja IMPOSSÍVEL andar pelo mapa sem ter 5 bichos te batendo e te deixando lento, alem disso o Boss fica quase impossível de se jogar contra no endgame, ele sempre sabe onde você está e vem em uma velocidade ABSURDA. Se os desenvolvedores dessem uma quantidade maior de lanterna UV para tentar combater tudo que o jogo proporciona, já seria de grande ajuda, mas enquanto o jogo esta neste estado é IMPOSSÍVEL zerar muitos dos mapas presentes no jogo. Sem contar que em muitos lugares no mapa você fica travado e tem que mexer a câmera para se desprender, algo extremamente chato e irritante.
Conclusão isso são coisas que deixam a experiencia MUITO CHATA, mesmo com os amigos esses problemas estragam a jogatina. Se isso tudo te incomoda (e tenho quase certeza que vai), não compre o jogo, não vale a pena pelo preço.",0.0,1752632726,False,1274570

"[h1]I Thought It Would Be Better[/h1]

I tried to like this game. I really did. But after nearly 55 hours, it’s still deeply disappointing.

[h2]Made in USA and From Mother Russia with Love[/h2]

 1.No, this isn’t a joke or a jab. The whole game feels like a Russia vs. USA are trying to relive their Cold War era. Why even set it in Europe if all we get are a few AI-controlled Latvian, Lithuanian, and Estonian units, and every Leopard 2 is crewed by Americans?

I came in expecting a CIS vs NATO scenario. Instead, I got Russia vs USA in the Baltics for some reason. Even the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 campaign made more geopolitical sense. Where are the European forces? Apparently, Russia threatened nukes if Europe steps in. [spoiler]Let’s ignore the fact that France doesn’t have a no-first-use policy, meaning they’d probably launch a tactical nuke at Russia as a “warning shot.”[/spoiler] So we’re just shredding Article 5 now? Cool.

I get the need for balance, so I won’t even touch the fact that the T-14 Armata is portrayed as a real battle tank, or that the RAH-66 Comanche randomly shows up like it’s just supposed to be here, with all It’s might and glory of 2 prototypes.

A genuine positive: Nothing boosts my serotonin quite like hearing a Russian unit yell “Parada moy!” (Googled it. Might be wrong. Still love it.)

[h2]It’s a Multiplayer Experience, All Right[/h2]

1.If you get lucky with a competent team—and an equally competent enemy—it can be fun. Sadly, those matches are rarer than a solar eclipse.

2.Splitting CIS from the rest of the world could work… until a Russian player joins, types in Cyrillic, and my Slavic brother in Christ, I’m sorry—I can’t read Russian. That is, if he doesn’t disconnect or get booted by the servers. Honestly, who knows anymore.

3.Speaking of disconnects: if you haven’t been randomly booted yet, count your blessings. Let me paint a picture:
3.1: You get disconnected mid-match.
3.2: Try to reconnect—nope.
3.3: Restart the game—still nope.
3.4: Restart Steam—nope again.
3.5: Restart your PC—congrats! You’ve now “deserted” the match hope those 20 minutes of playing were worth it.

4.Now imagine this:
4.1: You’re in a 5v5.
4.2: Two teammates rage-quit, because, their attack failed.
4.3: You’re left juggling their units while trying to hold the front.
4.4: They don’t return, so they’re marked as deserters.
4.5: No AI fill-ins. No surrender vote. No mechanics to try and balance the game.
4.6: You’re stuck in a lopsided match, wasting your time.

Want a fairer experience? Go play Wargame: Red Dragon 2.

5.Cheaters? Of course. Server crashes? Frequent. Quick fixes for leavers? Nonexistent. Surrender option? Still waiting.

[h3]48,99€[/h3]

For this price, I could buy Wargame: Red Dragon 2 with all expansions and still have money left for snacks.

Charging nearly €50 for a game with this many issues is laughable. I didn’t want to write this review—I hoped for updates and fixes. But it’s reached a point where I just don’t care anymore.

Overall: Wait for major patches or a deep sale. Right now, this game is not worth €50.",0.012843073593073595,1752691331,False,1604270

AoE IV brings back classic RTS gameplay with a modern touch. Unique civs, historical campaigns, and solid mechanics make it a great experience for both veterans and newcomers.

👍 What’s Great:

Distinct civilizations with unique mechanics

High-quality campaigns with docu-style storytelling

Polished tutorials and accessible design

Lots of replayability and strategic depth

👎 Needs Work:

Some missing features (scenario editor, deeper hotkey options)

Pathfinding and AI can still be clunky

Visuals feel a bit dated; limited camera zoom

Verdict:
A solid revival that nails the basics and offers hours of fun. It’s not perfect, but it’s definitely worth your time—especially if you love strategy.

"Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a clear step forward in almost every technical and quality-of-life aspect compared to its predecessor. The world is denser, livelier, and filled with more meaningful interactions. Many tedious systems from the first game have been polished or streamlined, making exploration, crafting, and even conversations flow more naturally. One of the best improvements is how smartly the game handles Henry’s skill reset—it doesn’t break immersion and actually makes perfect sense within the story. More games should take note of how to do sequels like this, especially when carrying over a protagonist. It also continues the tradition of stunning environments; the forests are still some of the most realistic I’ve seen in any game.

That said, I can’t help but feel a bit disappointed by how much easier this game feels compared to the first. Combat, while still solid, leans even more heavily on master strikes, and once you get the hang of it, there's barely any threat. Enemies are more forgiving, and resource management isn’t as punishing as it used to be. If you’re looking for a real challenge, I’d strongly recommend playing on hardcore mode with all the negative perks turned on. Don’t be afraid of it—if you already played the first game and understand how the mechanics work, it’s much more manageable than it sounds. Personally, I didn’t mind the lack of fast travel since I enjoyed roaming the world so much, but I can see it being frustrating for players who prefer a quicker pace. On a brighter note, achievement hunting is still just as straightforward as in the first game, with most of them being easily doable in a single playthrough—just be mindful of a few missables.

Story-wise, this sequel is more focused and cinematic. The characters feel more developed, and the narrative pacing is tighter overall. I found myself more invested in the plot this time around—but even so, I still prefer the vibe and emotional weight of the first game’s journey. There was something special about starting from nothing and slowly growing into someone with purpose and skill. That grounded, slower-paced rise gave the original a unique charm that the sequel, despite being grander, doesn't fully replicate. That said, the final act of KCD2 completely blew me away. The storytelling, buildup, and emotional payoff in those last sequences were top-tier. I genuinely enjoyed every minute of it—it was intense, well-written, and incredibly satisfying to play through.

What impressed me most is how the game continues to build immersion through small details. NPCs reacting to your appearance—whether you're bloody, clean, armored, or filthy—adds a lot of flavor to the world. I just wish the system had been expanded with deeper interactions or more varied consequences. The combat may lack the difficulty spike that made the first game so gripping, but it’s still satisfying in its own way. And while the game isn’t without its flaws—whether it’s the occasional bug, a bit of clunkiness, or systems that could use more depth—the overall experience is strong enough to overshadow those shortcomings. This game may not be perfect, but it's a rich, immersive, and rewarding journey that’s absolutely worth taking. It also feels like the natural conclusion to Henry’s arc—he’s come a long way since Skalitz—but at the same time, it opens the door to new adventures beyond this chapter. I can’t wait to see where the series goes next.",0.15221916131007038,1752392144,True,1771300

"Я бы назвал это плохим длс, но оглядываясь назад на новое дополнение здесь все не так уж плохо.
Плюсы:
-Новый геймплей. Вы создаёте камеры для содержания тварей , что бы создать новые пушки против органики (почти все аномалии дополнения), генераторы на новом ресурсе биоферите что можно автоматизировать .
-Новые угрозы. Кроме обычных болванчиков  заменяющих рейдеров, можно испытать опыт около амонг-ас и мафии где предатель- металлическая жуть, идеологический противник золотой куб, что будет ставить в палки в колёса , но давать хорошее настроение(может не так уж и плохо)
-новые возможности абуза игры, клонирование пешек, мутации конечностей, а также куча окультных ритуалов.
Минусы:
-Длс активно берет одеяло на себя.На вас всё ещё будут нападать культисты и твари за просто наличие длс активным. а средств против них у вас вряд-ли будет
-Биошматы, а именно генетическая мутация белки и зайца Пальцешип- быстрее гепарда, стукает больно и их бывает очень много в угрозах.А , и да, биошматы появляются в древнем зле.
-~70% новых угроз это рейдеры болванки с 1 особеностью и рескином. Зомби дерутся до конца. Химеры- медведи что разгоняются после получения урона.

Итог: длс перетягивает на себе одеяло большинство геимплея игры, но дает уникальные предметы и действия. Но не исследовать дл , но оставлять его включённым - глупо, если вы не планируете даже биоферит добывать на пушки.

"I love playing rimworld don't get me wrong and I love the idea of adding horror, and yes it's cool to effectively be a 'cult' that doesn't just eat prisoners, but can actually believe in something genuinely evil.

However, there is a major problem with Rimworld Anomaly that is horribly glaring. It doesn't mix well with the base-game or modded. Unlike Ideology, Biotech, and the recent introduction of Odyssey, this adds only one new way of setting up a colony and 'build.' So much so that this dlc probably ranks alongside Royalty as the worst dlcs(and the price increase certainly doesn't help.)

(This needs to be said now, this review is going to start spoiling other dlcs including this one, and I will not be censoring them, you have been warned.)

Unlike the other dlcs: ideology, royalty, biotech, and odyssey you can passively experience some of the new additions freely without making a play through solely be about them. For example Royalty allows you to have psylinks and ultratech weapons without needing to have the imperial faction be in the game. Ideology adds more quests to entice you to loot and complete even without ideoligions, and has a really good long-term end game where you progressively have to restart with the same people. Biotech is by far the best in the fact that you never need to touch the mechanitor half, or even the xenogeneology, you just have more ability to customize and mod your play through to play as a custom alien/mutant race. Odyssey, which I still have to experience more of, and am currently playing as I write this review, also adds new quests and while the space aspect is very appealing, the new biomes and animals are equally enticing and interesting, (even if some of it seems to share aspect to preexisting mods weirdly enough), alongside the ability to access colonial shuttles which has been addressed in so many mods and lead to the development of one of the most annoyingly easy to bug yet slightly required to avoid annoying long walks: Vehicle Framework.

So what does anomaly add that the others don't? Effectively it just adds a new straight forward 'questline' with new events and that's about it. 

Well that sounds ok, in fact it also sounds like that's the whole point of the dl- WELL unfortunately alot of the events, enemies and encounters are also horribly balanced at times to the point that it's more of a chore to deal with them than a genuine challenge or 'horror.'

Let's start with the Fleshmass heart... the other flesh-monsters are cool, you find them in abandoned settlements, neat. When a hole gets dug beneath you and you have to venture down and collapse a cave by slaughtering their queen, sweet that's nice! And then the Flesh mass heart... this one suffers both from it's main mechanic and the fact that all of the events and anomalies are either not mentioned or 'spoilered.' When it spawns, you can't hurt it immediatly... you can carve your way to the center through a barrage of gunfire and an epic battle through fleshmass, slowly wittling down your troops as more fleshbeasts spawn and as their needs start to get more intense all the while the fleshmass seals around them... That sounds cool doesn't it. Now imagine doing it three times in quick secession in order to defeat the heart... YEAH! what you have to do is drill to the center, take the nerve sample... then wait a ingame day for another to spawn... then drill to the center, nerve sample.. then wait a ingame day for another to spawn... then drill to the center,.. and no more epic battle just click the 'kill' button and then it explodes... After this multi-day trial and tribulation of repeating the once glorious battle you thought was cool multiple times... what do you get? A ball that spawns the worst meat in the dlc every few days... Good news, it's helpful if you're using ghouls... problem, it's only really helpful if you're using ghouls... yes you can turn it to fuel but there is already oodles of passive ways to get chemfuel sustainably(Chem reactor, Boomalopes, wood, and insect/human meat.) Overall this is such a niche reward for such a horribly designed task, which sucks more considering that there is already probably a ton of fleshbeast corpses nearby leftover from your battle with the heart... Oh also, if you don't contain it enough it just creates another fleshmass heart and the cycle repeats again... 

This same 'wait until you have three and suffer' style of mechanic is not just by itself here. The grey flesh event is made to suck the most and for new players is going to punish you severely if you're not aware of it(which is annoying since it's not only part of a spoiler based dlc, but also not part of the book of anomalys directly. So when you first encounter it you have no clue what you're going up against and are forced to watch as your colonists instantly die from something you can't physically control without having experienced it before. This especially sucks because there is a way to 'detect' the enemy, which turns out to be a fucking 'fully metal creature growing in your pawns.' The problem is that the way to detect the enemy requires for several sample of 'grey flesh' to spawn, and then you can finally surgically inspect and successfully detect (and end up unleashing them early, so it's not even a 'nice I outsmarted them moment' it's just a 'fuck this, i couldn't do anything until now.') It's ridiculous to not be able to detect a fully metal structure inside a pawn, like... surely your medics could find 'hints' that someone could be infected, or maybe there's a thing that you manually have to watch and see the pawns do like specific 'suspicious behaviors' instead of no info whatsoever. And the worst part, when you finally do unleash the Metalhorrors, you're told exactly how it got transmitted, but even with that knowledge if there's more metalhorrors you're not given an advantage with any of that information besides the initial patient zero which is most likely obvious in most situations.

Speaking of patient zeros, most patient zeros involve the 'Creepjoiners' mechanic, which is the closest thing that the dlc has to a 'outside of the main questline mechanic' and they have some of the most basic coding. Basically an event will pop up where someone with a strange yet obvious demeanor approaches your colony and wants to talk... these 'creepjoiners' come to join you with one benefit, one unusal status and one negative effect. 

These benefits could include 'transmuting resources, instakilling enemies(which enemies can't use for balance reasons), healing spells, absurdly high skill ranks, or even no need bars for food, sleep or comfort.' Which can be helpful and still encourage a player to look at these unusual pawns with suspicion, and punish players who are too relaxed with letting a 'creep' join your colony willy nilly.

The drawbacks are also interesting including things as horrible as metalhorror infection to 'nothing.' However mixed in to that catergory is also a wide variety of awful coding. 

For one, the weakest drawback i have found is 'Desertion' which will just cause the pawn to randomly leave after a while, no real reason as to why, and this is so easy to counter that you can just capture and then recruit the pawn after it tries to leave. 'Organ Decay' follows the normal organ decay affliction HOWEVER it will also make the organs impossible to remove without killing the pawn, this means that if they naturally decay in a non-vital organ unlike normal pawns that have organ decay... they will just die... and recieve 9999 damage to their wounds, which kind of proves that the devs really wanted it to hurt, but don't mention this anywhere, not even the wiki mentions this yet. 

That is really all I have witnessed in the code spaghetti and it really ruins my experience when a pawn dies from something they really shouldn't, cause I hate to have dev-mode ready in the background. 

I would reccomend trying biotech or ideology instead.",0.049766367891367874,1752629391,False,2380740

"It's been a long journey, but Victoria 3 has finally arrived at its destination: truly worth playing! After years of admittedly rough patches and DLCs that felt more like bandaids, the latest expansion has utterly transformed the game.
For a long time, Victoria 3 felt like a promise unfulfilled. The core concept was there, but the execution often left me wanting more. The economy could be opaque, diplomacy felt shallow, and the overall experience often lacked the dynamic depth we expect from a Paradox grand strategy title.
But with this new DLC, it's like a different game entirely. The revamped trade system, the genuinely impactful diplomatic options, and the depth added to various internal mechanics have breathed new life into the Victorian era. I'm no longer just staring at menus; I'm actively engaging with a vibrant, complex world where my decisions truly matter.
This isn't just a small improvement; it's a monumental leap forward. If you, like me, were initially disappointed and set Victoria 3 aside, now is the time to come back. The developers have clearly listened to feedback, and their dedication has paid off. Victoria 3 is finally the grand strategy masterpiece it was always meant to be. Bravo, Paradox! You've earned this positive review.

Los DLC's son muy llamativos y dan horas de contenido que mucho es de calidad, ademas que al comprarlos no se sienten como pay to win (de hecho en el contenido gratuito se consiguen mejores cosas) simplemente amplían tu arsenal llenándolo de posibilidades. 

Con este juego he pasado horas increíbles, tanto en solitario contemplando los paisajes como en con mis amigos completando actividades y mejorando el armamento ¿Pero entonces por que no lo puedo recomendar?

Pese a lo bueno que es, el juego es horrible para nuevos jugadores, tiene una trama e historia fascinante y entrañable, pero el hecho de que no este completa y no se pueda jugar de ningún modo coherente simplemente hace que te sientas desubicado y con muchas dudas con el juego. Muchos de los personajes tiene buena escritura pero están entrelazados a eventos pasados que ya no se pueden jugar, entendiendo el porque están ahí pero sin transmitir emoción que muchos veteranos si tuvieron haciendo una experiencia poco homogénea en la comunidad. 

Ademas de las actividades gratuitas y de ""early game"" el juego tiene una curva de dificultad muy retadora, obligándote a jugar con amigos o aprendiendo mucho meta y mecánicas. El tutorial no sirve como introducción ni de dichas mecánicas (muestra lo básico pero no te dice nada de las stats) ni tampoco te da contexto suficiente de la historia. 

Al forzar a otros a pagar por actividades a sobreprecio y a entrar a una historia muy desconectada hace que sea difícil convencer a otros jugadores y enseñarles a jugar este juego. Ademas últimamente las decisiones de Bungie son cada vez más cuestionables en su dirección y el hecho de que se borra contenido sin la posibilidad de re jugarlo hace que te plantees 2 veces si realmente vale la pena en invertir en el.

•	While it's slowly improving with each update, it's still far from acceptable.

2. Questionable balancing decisions
•	The game heavily rewards passive or “rat” gameplay, actively discouraging aggression.
o	Example: Nerfing wall penetration makes it easier for players to camp inside buildings.
o	Releasing and buffing silenced weapons.
o	Repeated buffs to traps.
o	Nerfs to stamina, poison resistance, and regeneration shots.

3. Performance issues
•	The beautiful graphics come at a cost: noticeable micro-stutters even on high-end systems.
•	A known issue causes VRAM not to unload properly, leading to decreasing FPS the longer you're in a session. The only 
        fix is restarting the game.

4. Broken matchmaking
•	The matchmaking system is completely unbalanced. The 6-star MMR bracket is so wide that I often get matched against players with double or even triple my playtime—especially frustrating as a solo player.
•	No ping limit: Many 6-star lobbies are filled with Chinese and Russian players abusing high ping on EU servers.

"Like many players, I took a hiatus from this wonderful game when the 1896 update flopped, and I was reluctant to come back. I logged back in a handful of times hoping that the game would at the least function properly and it seems that through all the tribulations this game has gone through, the devs finally got it to a stable state to build on, which is ironic given the judgement of the fool launch mishap. I've been playing it a lot the past couple of weeks and I've been having just as much fun as I did when I started playing pre-1896, which is extremely refreshing. The game isn't perfect by any means, but it's no longer frustratingly broken and actually runs better on my PC than it ever has before. 

If you're new, ignore the reviews about the UI and the 1896 doomsdayers. If you never played OG Hunt, the UI being changed won't be meaningful to you at all. After reminiscing about the old UI through videos and just from taking a long break from the game, I've actually changed my own mind and I think the devs were right and the new UI actually IS better than the old one. Perfect? No. Improved? Yes.

The other problem with the 1896 update was the removal of all the old maps and the atrocious issues with servers and technical performance, which led to the reviews falling to mixed. The old maps are back and the game definitely runs smoother than it ever has, so all of those old reviews are moot now. 

This is the first time I've been compelled to write a game review and I just want as many people to know that while definitely far from perfect, the game is enjoyable and on the upswing. If you need a sign to grab the game and hop in, this is it, especially while it's on sale. I purchased this game for many friends when I initially got into it and this is the first time it's been back to the point that I would do so again.

If you're an old player, now's the time to jump back in. If you're a new player, now's the time to dive in headfirst. See ya'll in the Bayou and enjoy the Hunt.",0.09440347787805414,1751724507,True,594650

"Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden follows the tale of Antea Duarte and Red mac Raith, lovers who've arrived in local settlement of New Eden, a fictionalized New England colony in the early years of settlement. Antea and Red are banishers by trade, a profession dedicated to putting to rest the undead. In the game universe, ghosts are not only real, but regularly manifest into the physical world to torment the living. Thus, banishers are something of a rarity, as one not only needs a gift for seeing the unseen, but also the combat prowess to fight them during field work. With this setting in mind, Antea, a master banisher and genius in her own right has been hired to put to rest an unsavory ghost haunting the colonists of New Eden. Accompanying her is her long time apprentice and lover, Red mac Raith, a warrior from the highlands turned soldier of fortune, and later banisher. Together the two must work together to stop the undead forces of New Eden and bring peace back to the colony.

The narrative of Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden begins shortly after Antea and Red's arrival in New Eden. Through a mixture of overconfidence, and inexperience, the two are taken by surprise by a specter known as The Nightmare, a malevolent entity which haunts the dreams of all the colonists. The Nightmare manages not only to slay Antea, but also send Red far out of New Eden. However, while most lovers part at death, Antea's rage and love bind her to the mortal plane, and her experience as a banisher affords her far greater control over her spectral talents than most spirits. Thus the two pair up to learn not only the identity of the mysterious Nightmare, but also find a way to stop her and reclaim Antea's body. In their journey, Red and Antea come across a number of settlements where colonists have fled to, each locale beset by various hauntings. Due to the nature of New Eden, spiritual activity is significantly more common than most other parts of the world, and thus nearly every colonist has been haunted either by a recent or long past tragedy. As Antea and Red work to solve the hauntings, they must make a choice whether to banish/ascend the ghosts or blame the colonists. While removing the spirits weakens Antea's ties, allowing her to more easily pass on, blaming the colonists will steal their life force, potentially allowing Antea to come back from the dead. The story is enjoyable, with the narratives of the colonists being a highlight, particularly as you follow them across multiple questlines. The overarching narrative is fairly predictable, but still enjoyable all the same.

The gameplay loop of Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden is fairly straight forward. Each settlement has one major questline tied to the identity of The Nightmare. Red and Antea work together to interview the colonists, uncover hidden clues, and ultimately fight an aspect of the Nightmare which has taken root around each of the settlements. Each settlement also has side quests tied to the personal storylines of each colonist, which play out similarly to the major questlines, though often omitting a boss battle at the end. The investigation and interview aspects of the game are by far its strongpoint, as much of the voice cast go all out, making it very enjoyable to listen to them recount their small ghost stories. Red and Antea can freely swap between one another, with Antea having the ability to perceive and interact with objects in the spiritual realm which Red cannot. There was a frequent feeling of The Witcher franchise while I played, not in the combat, but in this element of hunting down ghosts. In combat specters manifest either in spectral form or physical form. Red is strong against spectral opponents and visa versa, so the protagonists are encouraged to swap between each other in combat to tackle different foes. Red and Antea also have different abilities with Red being a bit heavier hitting and tanky, whereas Antea is faster and can travel greater distances. Unfortunately, the enemy variety is painfully underwhelming with probably only about 10 enemies in the entire game, and almost all of them having one attack. Thus, while Red and Antea have a large tech tree of not only different abilities, but also augmentations onto their existing ones, as well as an entire equipment tree with upgradeable weapons armor and accessories, there is very little reason to engage with any of the mechanics. Playing on the highest difficulty, the answer to almost every combat encounter was to hold Red's heavy attack, and just keep spamming it. The most challenging opponent was slight gradient hills, where the game failed to have Red move correctly, thus making attacks often fall short.

When Red and Antea are not hunting or fighting, they can engage in a number of side activities on the open world map, ranging from treasure hunting, to shooting spectral orbs hiding around the map. It all feels very generic open world, and the game would've been much tighter, and in my opinion better, if the developers had gone a different direction than open world. Most painfully is the fact that fast travel is restricted to only checkpoints, which means Antea and Red are relentlessly backtracking between quests, almost all of which are some variation of fetch quest. While I'm not one to typically complain about performance, Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden has several areas which didn't perform well, particularly around Fort Jericho, where it feels something is wrong. The stories of this game are its highlight, while the gameplay leaves much to be desired. Overall it's a game which would not rise to the top of my recommendations list, though I could see some fans desperate for more open world games to find enjoyment here.",0.03551227858293075,1752292322,True,1493640

"Amazing game with so much variety. This is like Elden Ring meets Breath of the Wild and Valheim with WoW Itemization.

The world is huge and filled with so much stuff to find, chests behind every wall, corner, secret door.. and you are free to do whatever you want. Can't get into the building? Just break the wall or build a hole into the roof. Just like that cause the game allows you to.
I really like the building system, it's actually one that doesn't make me wanna quit cause parts don't snap together the way I want them to. SO MUCH decor, animals, farming, my cozy game heart is enjoying it a lot!
Also the skill tree, the weapons, there is so much variety in how to play the game.
And last but not least. The options. To hard? no problem. More materials? no problem. Harder? More survival things like hunger? You can do it. Anytime. At any point in the game you can change any setting.

"Man oh man, how can you not love it?

Played the game with my best friend, and honestly? We had an absolute blast. Enshrouded is one of those games that just clicks when you’re exploring and messing around together.

We started off just punching trees and trying to figure out what the heck was going on, and before we knew it, we had a cool little base, a bunch of loot, and a long list of “accidental” deaths. Wandering into the Shroud too early? Yep. Building a tower that collapsed? Definitely. Pulling a boss we weren’t ready for? Every single time.

The game world is really nice to explore, and the combat + crafting systems are simple but satisfying. It’s even better because you’re constantly bouncing off each other, sharing loot, building stuff, laughing when someone forgets to eat and dies in the fog. There's just so much going on.

It can't always be perfect, there are a few bugs and some rough edges here and there, but nothing that ruined the fun. Honestly, we kind of liked the jank. Made the chaos even funnier, especially in dungeons. 

Bottom line is:
If you’ve got a friend to play with, this game is stupid fun. It’s like a chill survival RPG where every bad decision turns into a story you’ll laugh about later, and grinding is pretty much worth it.

"Leider kann ich es so wie es gerade ist (Stand 07.07.2025) nicht weiter empfehlen.
Mit Season 1 zeigt sich nun leider sehr deutlich das es im Grunde wie jedes andere mobile game ist nur mit einer anderen Verkleidung. Die Mechaniken und der Schwierigkeitsgrad aktuell sind so ausgelegt um ein erreichen des ""End-Games"" nur mit entweder mehreren hundert Stunden Spielzeit oder Geld auszugeben zu erreichen. Der Schwierigkeitsgrad wurde auch nur unnötig nach oben geschoben um das neue Gebiet künstlich in die Länge zu ziehen. Von den Shop Preisen fange ich erst gar nicht an aber ein Kosmetic für 34 Euro und dann nicht mal Account gebunden sondern nur Charakter ist schon sehr unverschämt.

Drei Beispiele:
-Das Broken Sword Artefakt Event
Hier zeigt sich schon mal um was sich die Season 1 dreht. Um ein neues Artefakt und die Mechanik dahinter. Natürlich ist es so integriert um Geld auszugeben wenn du die nötigen Ressourcen nicht hast um die Event Quest abzuschließen. Bekommst du zwei vom BS erhältst du ein drittes gratis. Nur leider wird dass der Großteil nicht erreichen.

-Die neuen Season Worm Walks und Beyond The Wall
Diese bauen natürlich auf das neue Artefakt auf und sind ohne dieses bzw. ohne hohen Momentum (Schwung) / Attack Power nicht machbar. So sind leider die Kosmetics/Belohnungen nur sehr schwer zu erreichen.

-Kraken Raid
Wurde angekündigt mit ""alle"" können mitmachen. Naja, nur wenn du 130K Schwung hast, und selbst dann ist es nicht leicht machbar da er zu schwierig ist und auch etwas buggy. Abgesehen davon es als Raid zu bezeichnen ist auch sinnfrei, da es sich eigentlich um eine 4er Dungeon handelt mit 5 Mechaniken.

Den Discord kannst du auch vergessen da hier niemand der berechtigte Kritik ausübt für voll genommen wird.
Cringe Discord trifft es da schon recht gut.

Ich persönlich werde jetzt noch Season 1 mitmachen und abwarten was sich noch ändern wird. Da aber Stand heute auch das Creator Programm ""vorerst"" auf Eis gelegt wurde und bis dato die Roadmap nicht veröffentlicht wurde, sehe ich keine gute Zukunft für das Spiel.

"ВНИМАНИЕ! Если вы ,вдохновившись My Summer Car или Voices of the void, искали игру с меланхоличным геймплеем, и атмосферой одиночества посреди пустыни. А именно такие ассоциации вызывает словосочетание, Заправка по среди пустыни. ЭТА ИГРА ВАМ НЕ ПОДОЙДЕТ!

Авторы игры считают, что если оставить игрока в спокойствии на 20 секунд, то игроку станет скучно и он  удалит игру. Поток машин сравним не с пустыней, а с МКАДом в ЧасПик. И не верьте игре, которая говорит, что количество клиентов зависит от рейтинга вашей станции. Оно зависит от количества бензоколонок, количества парковок, и количества товаров. Пример: Когда колонка одна, заправку ждут 2 клиента, когда колонки 3, заправку ждут 4-5 клиентов. За 30 игровых дней, я уходил от станции дальше склада 3 раза. 
Когда надо было включить генератор в первую ночь.
Когда надо было спуститься к Густаву по квесту.
И когда я запрыгнул в кабриолет к симпатичной брюнетке, и планировал умчатся в закат из этого ада.

Игра в теории имела огромный потенциал, меланхолия, мистика и атмосфера одиночества. И мистика тут есть, как призрак или НЛО, но вместо крипоты, это унылый декор, который использовал СИМС еще лет 20 назад. Игра из перспективы быть атмосферным симулятором превращена в Кликкер. Веселая ферма, только в 3Д.

В защиту игры, скажу, что хоть это и Кликкер, но кликкер не плохой. Геймплей затягивает, атмосфера и саунддизайн хороши. Моя оценка не объективна, потому что от игры я ждал другого. И она не оправдала моих ожиданий.",0.0,1752593501,False,1149620

"Mature themes and f-bombs galore, which I very much appreciate.  Classic FF enemies done justice.  Jaw-dropping interactive cinematics.  Interesting story.  Good looking characters.  Battle is easy enough to pick up, and abilities are exciting to progress, but stats & equipment progression isn't very exciting at all.  The rewards from doing quests were not that great and feel unnecessary to me. Having said that, I haven't tried New Game+ yet, so possibly there's other content that would take advantage of those things and the best equipment etc.

There are maybe 5 or 6 songs from the OST that I've added to my playlists, but that's possibly fewer than other FF games.  

I was hesitant to pick up the game because of performance concerns, but this game actually ran really well on my 5 year old ""decent specs but not the best"" system that I recently upgraded with an RTX 4070 SUPER.  That said, I don't like that so many other people have run into performance issues and hope that they get their act together to either set expectations on min hardware or resolve performance issues before that day 1 release.",0.17625391849529784,1752689242,True,2515020

"Great game it would be if you skip all the side content like your life depends on it and by side content I mean almost everything in between the story missions. Except the bosses. The game never meant to be even semi open world. Would be 10/10 if it was made closer to god of war than this sorts of RPG parody. Anyway, the main story is great and boss fights are crazy.

"[h1]Good Co-op farm game with potential...[/h1]

This game has a lot of potential and is really fun with a friend, [b]but[/b] this game really needs [b]some optimization[/b] and [b]quality of life[/b] stuff. I like that you can build your own farm, house, stables etc and you have the [b]freedom[/b] to roam the open world, go hunting, care for your animals and do a much more other stuff.

But there are some [b]stuff[/b] I really miss in this game and I hope that the devs will take care of it and add some of this into the game over the time.
[list]
    [*]Double beds have a bug where your partner has to log out and can't sleep in them in the prefab houses
    [*]Driving vehicles is really clunky and would need an optimization
    [*]Building fences without a guide that tells you how ofteh you have to rotate  is a real pain, would be cool if that changes
    [*]This game needs way more building structures like: Let us build brick or stone houses, more roof parts, way more decoration you can use, more house structures in general, real glass windows, chairs you can use
    [*]More food variety, maybe sausage with seasonings, steaks, grounded beef etc
    [*]Give us a list that shows how many animals we have, it's really annoying counting all your chickens over the time
    [*]Friends who logged out should respawn at the place they logged out, not on the bus station
    [*]Maybe some terraforming? I would love a pond with ducks etc and the game really needs the option to build gravel paths or something like this
    [*]Decorative trees, bushes, fruit trees etc would be awesome
    [*]Maybe a more lively city with NPCs walking around, the current NPCs who give quests or work in the shops just sitting there and doing nothing. Some other ranchers who you can sell stuff would be awesome and give the world more life.
[/list]

But don't let you [b]distract[/b] from this list, the game still is fun with friends or alone (If you prefer it this way). It has some really nice things and features already and it seems like the devs still work on this game with their [b]roadmap updates[/b], but still this game needs some more love, fixes and quality of life updates.

"The game feels overly simplistic, almost as if you’re just watching an adult film. The dialogues lack depth, requiring you to agree with everything like a robot. There are no engaging mechanics or meaningful interactions to keep you invested. Transitions between casual conversations and intimate moments are abrupt - within a minute, the character is already waiting for you in bed. Adding even a touch of realism would improve the experience significantly.

"прокурор завел дело на кота по кличке ""Mr. Penis"" за то, что тот скинул со стола и разбил любимую кружку хозяйки.

как позже выяснилось, кот был рекордсменом по прыжкам и скорости бега, но имел ожирение, а также был замечен ранее в том, что продырявил джинсы. Позже доктор подтвердил, что этот кот просто ужас, поставив ему диагноз полного распиздяя.

Адвокат же начал приводить аргументы, что наша хозяйка является шизофреничкой, которая прошла сво, получила птср, и теперь у нее дома лежит штурмовая винтовка АК-47. По версии адвоката и свидетеля-полицейского это хозяйка разбила свою же кружку во время припадка, а затем обвинила в этом кота, которого позже повязал и привез в суд тот самый полицейский. Еще в квартире хозяйки был найден кальян, а также ее кровь на разбитой кружке, что также подтверждает версию о том, что это она разбила кружку.

Под конец заседания прокурор привел улику, что у кота были найдены окровавленные сюрикены, что намекало на то, что Мистер Пинус является вовсе необычным котом. Теперь сложилась версия, что кот разбил кружку, но чтобы уж точно его не посадили, он поранил хозяйку сюрикенами и пролил кровь на кружку, чтобы суд обвинил хозяйку в клевете и освободил кота.

"Thumbs Sideways — Great Tech, Underwhelming Gameplay Loop

There’s a lot to like about Shapez 2 on the surface. The factory structures are visually interesting and suggest a promising future. The graphics are clean and modern, the interface is intuitive and slick, and I didn’t encounter a single bug during my playthrough — which is no small feat for an early release.

However, the core gameplay loop left me wanting more.

The constraints system — which could have added challenge and creativity — barely factored into my experience. I never came close to hitting the structure limits, so it didn’t really influence my designs. Side quests start off engaging but quickly become repetitive and feel disconnected from the rest of the game. Once you’ve completed the factory for a quest, it has no ongoing purpose, making it feel like a one-and-done effort with little payoff. The operator badge path alone provided more than enough science to complete progression, making side quests largely irrelevant past the early game.

Unlike Factorio, where your early builds continue to support and evolve into your later infrastructure, Shapez 2 factories feel isolated and disposable. Each one solves a narrow problem, then gets ignored. There’s no sense of a growing, interconnected machine.

The shape mechanics, while initially novel, lack depth. I’d love to see a system where advanced shapes are constructed from simpler ones — a hierarchy where you’re constantly building up from base components. Imagine only starting with quarter circles and squares and needing to combine and split them to reach complex forms — similar to the color mixing system, which is far more satisfying in comparison.

Lastly, it would be a huge improvement if producing shapes was actually necessary to build new structures. That would tie your creations directly to progression and give a real sense of purpose to what you’re building.

Bottom Line: Shapez 2 has excellent production values and real potential, but the current gameplay loop feels shallow. Here’s hoping future updates bring more depth and interconnectedness to match the polish.Thumbs Sideways — Great Tech, Underwhelming Gameplay Loop

"First off, I sadly didn't play the base game, so I don't know if or how much it was better before the Phantom Liberty Patch. Now it's basically a fancy shiny interactive 3D visual novel.
The Perksystem is so basic and straightforward, there are no choices other then the most basics. Assaultrifles/SMGs? Reflexes, left part. Tech Weapons? Technical Ability, right part. Want stealth? Cool, middle part. Movement? Reflexes, middle part. So choose your weapon type and play style and your done, the only variety is in the order you will take your perks.
I read there once was a crafting system. If you are here for that, turn around, it's a lie. You can disassemble items into scrap of its tier and you need a certain amount to upgrade iconics and thats all the important stuff.
Clothing is only for decoration of a character you nearly never see, for gameplay it's irrelevant. I read there was once more to it, but it got scrapped, because. Sad.
Now I could probably go on but let's cut this short. It's a nice game if you want to run around in a cyberpunk setting and kill things or to walk along the (rather nice) story (just be aware your choices don't really matter). But if you are here for that RPG feeling of tinkering on character builds, know it's of a kiddie-sandbox-playpen level, falling ridiculously short of what it could have been.",0.06093749999999999,1752684903,False,2138330

Combat is less buggy than Chiv 1, but frequently still get people hitting me without even looking at me. Melee is the only fun thing in this game",0.054166666666666655,1752687158,False,1824220

"You don't have to be a hardcore sw fan to play. All the classes feel great, I love the stories, and the fact that your character actually speaks makes me really happy. I played through a few storylines, and the most boring so far is the consular and even that was interesting enough to keep my attention till the end. Inquisitor was my fave so far. I didnt even notice I was using the free version because paying for stuff with real money doesnt get you anything super necessary until possibly late game. Paying the sub for this game is still worth it though if you're going to make this the one mmo you play!",0.1214912280701755,1748189601,True,1286830
