"I hate this game with a passion beyond words - Sometimes. Right now, they force you to listen to minutes of sub par k-pop every time when you try to start a round. Makes me want to chuck my computer out the window. Fuck you PUBG.",-0.30285714285714294,1752615136,False,578080

"[b] I'm Steam user since 2009. I played Counter-Strike 3858 hours. I played Counter-Strike: Global Offensive 2269 hours. I never used violation software or cheated on any Steam games! On July 12 2025, a red sign VAC banned showed on my user profile page! I contacted Steam support, Steam support told me that it's not VAC banned, It was permanent banned by PUBG. 

So I contacted PUBG support. PUBG support said that ""we can confirm that a permanent ban was applied on 2025-07-12 due to a confirmed violation of our Terms of Service."" But I didn't do anything violation. 

On July 12 2025 I only logged in the PUBG to purchased skins. I added money to Steam wallet three times in PUBG ""buy G-coins"" page. Then, I used the Steam wallet credits to purchased G-coins. And I used all the G-coins to purchased skins boxes. Then I opened all skins boxes, After that I equipped the skins. At the end, I logged off. That's everything I did on July 12 2025.

I told the PUBG support everything I did on July 12. And I asked the PUBG support ""what kind of violation I did on July 12? I paid money to your game and got banned next day."" The answer was ""Unfortunately, for security reasons, I can’t share specific details about the violation."" Are you kidding me? Security reasons? I didn't do anything violation!!!!!!

Hey Steam! I'm a Steam user. I trust Steam so I bought a lot of games on Steam. And now a game sell on Steam can permanent banned your user for no reason! BTW, the PUBG was not a free game on 2017. It's $29.99. And I spend $145 on July 12 2025![/b]",-0.08653846153846154,1752611530,False,578080
"This game has become a joke, every second player in this game is hacking at the moment and the dev's do nothing about it because these are the types that buy skins.",-0.26666666666666666,1752608893,False,578080
