I believe the game is pitting players that are new to Random by making you the next big target for those senior players. Ranked Battles are very painful to play or survive longer than a minute or so when ships start firing. I never did like PVP in MMOs and it really shows in this game how, without new players being the goat, would loose favor quickly because everyone had overpowered ships they had purchased.",-0.08705749805749807,1752815100,False,552990

"Almost a great game.
My impression --> The game is quite fun and interesting probably the better of the triage of Wargaming.net games. However, up to level 5 ships can be researched and bought through the players normal grind. At level 6 and above unless you've purchased a DLC that contains a ship above level 5 the game loses its pull for me. Level 6+ ships require Doubloons that never drop and can only be bought. All the fancy ships require currencies that are impossible to acquire without purchasing in-game items. If you don't mind playing below level 6 with the exception of DLC's you will actually enjoy the battles.  Doubloons are the major in-game currency and the caveat being that unless doubloons start dropping the paywall truly separates further progression in play unless you're willing to fork out some serious cash for the really boss ships they offer by buying the in-game currencies.",0.03486842105263157,1752448003,True,552990

"Raporlama ve FF sistemi gelene kadar önerilecek oyun değil. Oyunu satan elemanlar mı dersiniz, birisine kıl olduğu için son dakikada kendi kalesine gol atanlar mı dersiniz her bok var. Oyunda genelde iki oyuncu yan yanayken topu neden birinin değil diğerinin vurduğunun herhangi bir açıklaması da yok. Kastım şu ki oyunda fena bir sistem olmamasına rağmen benim karakterim topa daha yakın olmasına ve pingim de gayet güzel olmasına rağmen arkamdaki oyuncu topa Juventus Ronaldonun 3-4 katı yukarı zıplayarak vuruyor ve kalecinin zıplaması sırasında elinin eriştiği mesafenin bile üstünden vurduğu topla gol atıyor... Aşırı bencil oynayan oyuncular da var ki zaten insanı çileden çıkartıyorlar. Ses sistemini kullanmıyorum fakat görünen o ki seste birisi sizi trollerse yapabileceğiniz tek şey tüm takımı susturmak (evet elemanlar kişileri teker teker susturma sistemini bile eklememişler).

Bir de Türkiye sunucusunda ki oyuncu sayısı az olacak ki üst üste aynı oyuncularla 3-4 maç denk geldik ve aynı adamla oynamak keyif vermiyor.

"Today was my final day in this game, i have stopped actively playing for various reasons, but when logging in today and seeing what was left of all my hours of work, I uninstalled and will not be returning to this game. At least not any time soon.

SO, i got this game just a few days after its official release, played the everloving shit out of it, got to duraluminum tier in a little over a week, just about by myself. had a few friends hopping, built a big guild base, just a bunch of casual guys nothing too crazy. light thopters, mediums, did everything available (that i could find) in Hagga Basin, and did not like the DD that much, just my opinion, it sucks. so, we decided to stock up the base with enough fuel and i saved up enough money for months of taxes, we could afford to be offline for a long time, and I just log in and pay taxes every cycle, and wait for new content to drop, hopefully something thats worth doing. this was a week ago. today i log in to go pay my taxes, and to my surprise, EVERYTHING in our base is GONE. all our vehicles, containers, everything. all that is left, is our generatos, still filled with WEEKS worth of fuel. note, i had no taxes overdue from previous cycles, just this weeks, on the weekly reset. WTF happened to all of our stuff I do not know, but i am not going to stick around and try to find out and do all of that work all over again, or try and deal with Funcom and open a ticket, as they just about useless when it comes to customer support. 

If you are just a casual player and you are seeing this, DO NOT buy this game. Its a waste of time, and there realistically is nothing to do in this game past maybe 200 hours. I am aware i have less but I have a problem with survival crafting type games, i progress a lot faster than most folks and that being done about 90% as a solo. The game is riddled with bugs and exploits, that other people WILL use against you. hackers and exploiters that will make your experience not enjoyable and will you or destroy your stuff even in the PvE areas of both Hagga and DD. 

i had fun with this for the most part, as i really like the Dune universe and this was a fun experience, but ultimately there just is not anything to keep you playing if you are a casual player and dont have that much interest in PvP. The whole tax system is a bunch of BS as well, its just there to try and retain relevancy for the game, so people have a reason to login and forces them to keep playing or all of their progress on a base will be gone. This game will not survive for very long, and it is already showing. Games that usually make use of such predatory tactics, and with so very little content to offer dont make it very long anyway. 

Bless the Maker and His water. Bless the coming and going of Him.
May His passing cleanse the world. May He keep the world for His people.

"Hubo una noche en la que abrí Persona 3 Reload solo porque no quería pensar en mí mismo.
Tenía sueño, pero no tenía paz.
Y cuando no tenés paz, cualquier cosa con colores y música suave sirve como anestesia.

Pasé horas subiendo estadísticas sociales de un personaje al que yo mismo le tenía envidia.
Él dormía bien, estudiaba, entrenaba, tenía vínculos.
Construí amistades.
No porque el juego me lo pidiera, sino porque, en medio del desastre, necesitaba hablar con alguien.

Me encariñé con personajes que no existen.
Lloré por un final que no me pertenecía.
Y cuando terminé y cerré el juego, vi mi reflejo en el monitor negro.
No era un héroe.
Era un tipo solo, con una vida vacía, y 120 horas menos de vida real.

Lo que pareció una historia de anime.... Empezó a sentirse peligrosamente cercana.

Al escalar Tártaro, el juego me hacía pensar que estaba avanzando.
Pero la verdad es que el que está atrapado en una torre soy yo.
Una torre invisible, solitaria. Llena de pasillos vacíos donde me repito a mí mismo que mañana va a ser distinto.
Mentira.
Mañana va a ser otro piso igual. Otra excusa, otra noche donde no va a pasar nada. Cada escalón es una repetición.
Un día más donde me levanto, hago lo mismo que ayer, y espero que algo cambie, aunque en el fondo sé que no va a pasar.

En la torre, hay enemigos, enemigos que atacan, y hay que pelear.
En mi vida, los golpes no son visibles,
son silenciosos y profundos: la ausencia de ganas, el peso de la melancolía,
las palabras que nunca dije y que se quedaron atoradas en mi garganta.

Persona 3 no es sobre salvar al mundo.
Es sobre ver cómo el tiempo te pasa por encima mientras tratás de que alguien te diga ""me alegra haberte conocido"" antes de que todo termine.
No me rompió, me recordó que hay cosas que no se reparan, solo se llevan con uno.
Calladas.

"As a pretext, I am a predominantly MnK player who has played and done very well on controller before, as it isn't really a challenge to. I would consider myself a very high level player as I've dropped multiple 30+ kill games on Warzone BR Solos and probably am top of a multiplayer lobby 95% of the time. Onto the review.

Ricochet anti-cheat: does absolutely nothing. Even if it did, aim assist is essentially just legal aim bot anyway. They said it themselves: a mass majority of reports are on console players, who in almost all cases are incapable of being able to hack, at least compared to PC players. This can only mean that players are reporting people because of their inhuman cheat-like aim that is gifted to them for squeezing the left stick on their baby rattle.

Movement: ""New evolution of movement"" only lasted about 2 weeks on launch until they nerfed all of it to the ground. Feels clunky and slow for being marketed as a fast paced arcade shooter. If you want movement, play literally any other game at least until jet packs come back or something.

Gun-play: feels abysmally horrible for anyone who has to actually see what they are aiming at to hit bullets. They did multiple pass-throughs for visual recoil and it is still nearly impossible to track a target without the game doing it for you. Additionally, every action requires you to put your gun down for 5 seconds which only makes it harder to play aggressively and have any fun whatsoever.

Nearly zero gun balancing other than nerf every gun people like and buff new battle pass guns temporarily so that people buy tiers or bundles. Nearly every ""weapon patch"" is increasing damage range on a class of guns by 1.4 meters and nothing else.

Monetization: Somehow worse than supply drops. I'd gladly play one or two games for a supply drop for a chance at cool loot than be constantly be berated over and over again to spend $30 on Stan Smith, Beavis and Butthead, and the Ninja Turtles. I'd maybe sort of understand if the whole game was free to play, but it isn't. ""At least you know what you're getting"" no one cares when you are paying $30 for a skin you use for 2 days and a weapon blueprint for a gun that gets nerfed the next day. Not to mention you literally can't see the operator you spend money on as it is a first person game. I'll always stand by AWs supply drop system since it was the most customization of any COD and you got a supply drop literally every game.

Progression: No progression except for level (means nothing other than weapon unlocks and showing play time to others) and camos. Camos would be cool if they weren't made incredible easy to get compared to older cods. I managed to get Dark Matter and Nebula in the first month without even trying. Same with MW2 and MW3. Warzone was more difficult but now you can just farm bots so you can do it in literally 2 days if you wanted.

Matchmaking: Mainly talking about multiplayer here, as Warzone's matchmaking is more forgiving due to needing 150 players. It's basically impossible to kick back and enjoy a game unless you suck major ass at the game and don't care to do well at all. It used to be do good one game, get cooked for the next couple. Now it's just get cooked the whole time. I just played around 10 matches in a row. Each one only consisting of prestige master players using the same weapon (LC10) snaking the objective for the win while I'm just trying to complete a challenge for an event.

Warzone: Usually a buggy mess. Currently the only map for BR is Verdansk which is extremely boring as it is now a 5 year old map with no new points of interest or any good quality of life updates. Same with Rebirth, but even worse somehow as it is literally the same exact map that we got 4 years ago. Servers are usually trash as well, so much for ""ping is king"". Since it's free and there is no anti cheat, expect cheaters nearly every game. Do not play ranked. Just don't.

Basically, the game sucks. BO6 is a bottom 5 COD, MW3 was ok, and MW2 is a bottom 1 COD. Activision's greed and whatever the hell is happening at the developer studios has ruined Call of Duty if not forever, at least for the foreseeable future. The only real hope for this franchise to release actual good games is a change of upper management as well as a major change in the lazy, greedy, and insanely mindless way that the games are made. As well as, of course, a working anti-cheat and a nerf to aim assist.

"Went from loving playing this game at the beginning to hating it now. It sucks to play co-op because the only real way to progress your skills and unlock recipes is through books. If you find a book and read it, its gone forever. So the game becomes ""who can get to the book the fastest"" instead of actually being a decent co-op game. I played this game back in 2016 and the co-op was completely different and actually fun. Progression was similar to Skyrim where the more you practised the skill the better you got. Now, its just book hunting and loot, loot, loot before anyone else can get there.

Movement also is abysmal, you run SO slow and you have to travel pretty far to find all the stupid books you need in order to level up and actually craft anything. If you want to leave the starter biome, no you don't. They have nuked the biomes so they are basically unplayable because they are forcing you to play by their rules. On top of that, it is so poorly optimised its actually infuriating. The devs seem to only care about what the characters look like so now your character is basically 4K and the rest of the graphics could be from an old PlayStation 2 game. 

I find it funny they call themselves ""The Fun Pimps"" because I feel like if you don't play the game the way they intend you to they completely rework it making it the least fun possible. The game is just grinding the whole time until you get bored which is pretty fast. 

Truly I thought this game was gonna be the next big thing. How could you mess up such an incredible plot for a game? The developers don't even realise the potential for what they had. I really want to like this game, but I just can't. It has been ruined and it genuinely pisses me off.",-0.028594771241830068,1752884622,False,251570

Your ""New"" hard mode, is easily the laziest implementation of a difficulty system I've ever had the displeasure of taking part of. Guys... making street gangsters Chris Kyle with pistols across the map is not well thought out.. or hard.. it's lazy.

I'm all for more enemies, I like how they seem to try and run/flank more too. I don't like, that a pixel can be showing of my character through a bunch of assets in between, and I get sniped/wall banged instantly.

It also seems like you made my AI officers the complete opposite and un-reactive. Either all of the AI is cracked out, or none of them are. Dumbing down friendly AI, while making the enemy insane... is once again lazy work.

You need to go back to the drawing board with the AI, maybe take some classes on it, cause the approach to making it ""Harder"" is shallow, and not well thought out. I'd actually like a challenge please, not AI cheese. Thanks",0.025368265993265995,1752886782,True,1144200

-Good variety of units
-graphics are solid
-custom battle groups
-realistic weapon system behaviors in most cases

Con's
-Russian bias ( example: a btr-90 cannot and will not solo an Abrams sep3)
-no matchmaking penalty for leaving matchs early (should be loss of ELO and a lengthy cooldown)
-no player report feature ( sadly yes there are already cheaters and trolls)
-no SBM
-ELO rank seems pointless and doesnt serve a purpose
-no friendly AI in SKirmish

Hopes and Dreams
-nerf russian faction to reflect realism
-new factions (china, UK, AUS, Germany, Iran, Etc..)
-New maps
-naval units? (ships, subs, etc.)

"From World in Conflict to the Wargame series and WARNO, from R.U.S.E. to Steel Division 2, I’ve always been a loyal fan of this genre. I purchased Broken Arrow immediately after the Vanguard Edition went live and have played over 70 hours (mostly PvP) with excitement. I can see the developers’ efforts in recreating military models and building modern warfare mechanics. The game has high potential. However, at this stage, I wouldn't recommend it. Here are the main reasons why:

Neglect of PvE Players
This genre has a large PvE player base, but the developers have clearly overlooked this audience. For example, the official campaign lacks save/load functions, and there was no skirmish mode at launch. The recently added skirmish mode feels rushed and underwhelming.

Limited Modding Support
While the game includes a scenario editor and supports the Steam Workshop, it doesn’t allow adding custom units (including models, UI images, etc.) or editing unit data. Even fan-made localization mods are sometimes banned. This means the game is unlikely to have rich, expandable mods in the short term.

Poor PvP Experience for Solo Players
PvP can be a frustrating experience for those who prefer to play solo. The forced 5v5 format often results in matches being effectively lost at the start due to poor team balance. The server imposes minimal penalties on players who quit mid-game or even at the start. In fact, rage quitters sometimes lose fewer ELO points than players who stay and try to fight. Once you reach 1000+ ELO, matchmaking becomes increasingly unfair, with large disparities between team ratings. Many top-ranked players are clearly climbing via pre-made squads, making it extremely unfair for solo queue players. Getting stuck with leavers against coordinated squads ruins the experience. 1 v 1 and 2 v 2 mode is required!!

Misaligned Priorities in Game Design
The unit models are beautiful, but too resource-intensive for an RTT game. This compromises overall environmental quality—maps often look rough and lack polish, worse even than Wargame: Red Dragon and WARNO. The high asset fidelity may also slow down future DLC development. While the current unit pool seems large, it gets repetitive over time, and the lack of a proper modding interface severely limits replayability and content expansion.

Immature Anti-Cheat Measures
The current anti-cheat system is underdeveloped, which affects PvP integrity and enjoyment.

Gameplay is fine but Not Realistic
While the battles are fast-paced and intense, the game does not realistically simulate modern warfare. It uses theater-level support assets in platoon-level battles, features exaggerated weapon ranges, lacks electronic warfare and realistic drone functionality, and has wildly inaccurate damage values. These may be balance decisions, but they undermine the game's claim to realism.

Conclusion:
The game has potential and the developers show sincerity and a willingness to listen to players. However, the current lack of polished single-player content and a frustrating multiplayer environment are serious issues. Given the price point, I cannot recommend this game to fans of realistic war sims who are on a budget. If money is not a concern, consider buying it to support future development—but take my advice: don’t play it yet. Keep the mystery alive, and wait until 80%+ of the reviews are positive before diving in.

从冲突世界到战争游戏系列和WARNO，从RUSE到钢铁之师，一直以来都是这类游戏的忠实粉丝，从两次测试到先锋版发布立刻就买，怀着激动的心情玩了70多小时(主要PVP)的Broken Arrow，看得到制作组在还原军事武器模型和现代战争的游戏机制方面的努力，游戏拥有很高的潜力，但是很遗憾，现阶段我没办法推荐大家购买这款游戏。主要有如下几个原因：

1.这类游戏有很大的PVE玩家群体，但制作组显然极大的忽略了这部分玩家的体验感，诸如官方战役不能存档读档，以及首发没有遭遇战，而补丁更新的遭遇战明显像赶工出来的东西，差强人意；

2.官方发布了自带的场景编辑器以激活Workshop的创作者，但编辑器并不能加入新的自定义单位（包括独立的模型，UI图片等），也不能对单位数据做任何编辑，甚至于一些本地化语言的民间补丁也会被官方封禁，因此短期内，您购买本游戏可能很难玩到内容丰富，扩展性强的MOD；

3.PVP的环境对于习惯一个人玩的玩家来说体验非常糟糕，由于强制性的5 V 5 导致每一场战斗都存在极大的开局就注定会输掉的情况，服务器对中途甚至开局就离开游戏的玩家几乎没有惩罚，在失败的条件下，逃跑的玩家有时候甚至ELO减分低于努力战斗到最后输掉比赛的玩家，而当你打到1000+分的时候，你会发现服务器的匹配机制经常非常的不公平，两边的等级和ELO都会差异很大，而强制性的5 V 5还会加剧另外一个问题，榜单前面的玩家大多人的胜率很明显就是靠组队打上去的，这对于没有办法固定时间组队玩的个人野队玩家非常的不公平，离开的队友面对对面组队的队友，游戏体验很糟糕；

4.制作组的模型做得很精美，但是看起来并不符合RTT游戏类型的需求，高精度的模型对资源的占用很高，导致牺牲了游戏的环境品质，游戏地图场景的整体效果相比单位模型显得很粗糙，甚至不如同类型的战争游戏红龙和WARNO，另外就是这种不太成熟的制作经验可能会让制作组更新新的扩展内容DLC的速度变得非常缓慢，而现有的内容看起来十分丰富，但是玩久以后也略显无聊，加之制作组没有合适的MOD接口，这极大的限制了这个MOD的扩展可能和新内容的更新速度；

5.对于作弊的侦测存在不成熟性，这一样影响了PVP的游戏体验；

6.游戏的战斗节奏很紧张，节奏很刺激，但是游戏并不能很好的拟真现代战争的形式，首先就是使用战区级别的支援武器支援连，排级别的战斗，夸张的武器射程比例尺缩放，没有太多体现现代战争电子战，无人机等的重要性，以及完全失真的武器伤害效果，你可以说这是为了平衡游戏，但是这绝不是一个拟真的现代战争游戏；

总而言之，游戏具备潜力，制作组拥有诚意，愿意一定程度的与玩家沟通并修改游戏，但非常有限且不成熟的单机内容和糟糕的多人游戏服务器环境是目前存在的严重问题，相对于这个游戏的价格，我不会推荐喜欢战争模拟游戏但预算有限的玩家购买这个半成品，但如果你的财力没有问题，可以买下支持制作组开发出更好的内容，但相信我，别打开玩他！保持对他的神秘感，等到你看到评论区超过80%好评以后再玩。",-0.06693429834054833,1752884677,False,1604270

"Да, я тот человек, который на основе имеет п0рnо игры, прошёл на платину, и ставит дизлайк игре... не смотря на то что остальные схавали эту ж0пу с сіськами.. Есть вопросы? Надеюсь нет, я их не задавал. В любом случае хочу немного отойти от сути, и сказать что это будет юбилейный 50-ый высер моего никому [strike] (почти, всё таки я лично вижу в этом смысл) [/strike] мнения. Вы даже не представляете, насколько мне дорога эта площадка с появлением энтузиазма и бабла иногда, чтобы что-то делать и самовыражаться. Спасибо всем, кто реально это читает, ат души душевой реально. :luv:
А также надеюсь, что прокомментирую каждую игру + поиграю из своей библиотеки как минимум. Потому что я заемал быть архивариусом который не смотрит библиотеку, kekw. Ладно насрал нормально, перейдём к сути почему мне не нравится эта игра, спустя 88 часов и полной платины:

[h1] Stellar Blade.. это вообще игра? Или всё таки Аниме интерактивное, с крутым опенингом и треками, но абсолютно без уникальной идеи? [/h1]

Для начала стоит начать, что я не абсолютный хейтер этой игры совсем, и в кое каких моментах понравилась... как проходняк. Ну и то что ГГ красивая, хотя определённо идея взята с 2B, Байонетты и элементов Лары Крофт. [spoiler] (те самые перекладины, типа ""паркура"" для всякой х3рни, ДА ШИФТ АП? Кринж ёбаннныыый) [/spoiler] Ну и ещё моментик, что в совокупности пережитого за всё это время, когда меня не тянуло засесть в афк надолго.. например из-за гринда мобов - игра не оправдывает свой дорогущий фуллпрайс. Хотя может потому что издатель Сони, контора сами знаете кого + сомнительная, ну не по теме обзора, но кто понимает тот понимает. И поскольку в Стиме, нельзя как-то оценить средне, я больше таки [b] не рекомендую её ВАМ [/b], кто читает этот текст пробовать и вообще запускать, даже если обойдут Дерьмуво у игры и выяснят ""реальный фпс"", без нагрузок да.. Но вообще в целом как я заметил, основные признаки говнявости этой игры в целом у многих совпадают, видел похожие мысли и мнение.. А значит всё таки это реально такие проблемы, которые перечислю ниже.

Краткая характеристика игры, по плюсам и минусам.
Плюсы: -Главная героиня, и её жопа с кастомайзом(ну это не удивительно, гача разрабы же);
-Саундтрек, не весь нравится прям. Но это прям лютейший разйоб, я отвечаю, даже некоторые в плейлист добавил. Хотя попахивает будто DMC, но то ладно, допустим;
-Вариативность концовок, и по всяким нахрюк/инсайдам, хотят сделать в сиквеле вариативность прохождения. Что-то на подобии Масс Эффекта, звучит интересненько хмм.

А вот в минусах буквально бесит всё, что эта игра показала за 88 часов и то, что многие предпочитают закрывать глаза на это: 
-Лор, он хуйня и в контексте пост-апокалиптеческого мира могли бы придумать получше эти азиаты дрочегачи..
-Безэмоциональность персонажей, да, для кого-то может этот тейк прям сильно субъективный.. Но я смотря катсцены, некоторые из-за блока скипа по несколько раз - я чувствую вайбы ""зловещей Галины"" на их лицах. Хотя в целом ладно, можно списать что они все биоботы.
-Сайдквесты, тут понятно в чём минус, затягивают геймплей по методичкам, как примерно это делают все крупные игры.
-Локации, а конкретно больше раздражают реально те 2 пустыни ссаные. Разрабы сделали максимально душные 2 локации, которые геймплейно ПОВТОРЯЮТ ДРУГ ДРУГА по принципу лута и что там по 2 босса, господа, это реально кринжатина мда.. Понятно вообщем.
-Боёвка и лутизм. По поводу последнего сразу скажу, это примерно одинаковая причина почему и сайдквесты г0вно. А вот за боёвку до конца не скажу, как говорили другие на опыте Секиро, Дарк Соулсов и.т.д(потому что я в них не играл сам). Но ты буквально на всех сложностях с учётом почти фулл вкача навыков выносишь врагов с помощью бета 1,2,3,4 + если есть альфа, то Alt+1,2,3,4.. Ну это просто факт и всё, нету тут прям сильной нужды скилла особой. Даже на сложном, хоть допустим в апдейте Манна и платном длс-коллаб с их игрой Nikke - Скарлет. Они подкрутили ебейшие атаки и абилки, но я не считаю их как контру, что боёвка от этого интереснее становится. Такое

Теперь рассмотрим детальнее некоторые пункты, а именно почему таки конкретно лор/сюжет вокруг этой игры и сайдквесты по сути полная хрень и напоминает дешёвое аниме.. Я постараюсь максимально без спойлеров кнч, но будто такое не особо жалко и проспойлерить, хах. Начну пожалуй с квестов, которые идут вне сюжета.. Тут честно зависит смотря про какие идёт речь, и от какого перса. Если брать их из табло поручений, то логически подумав.. что-то дохуя времени у челов находится, чтобы их составлять и надеяться что кто-то выполнит хмм. Но это побольшей части ладно, заданки ради денег и вещей по своей сути. А вот, если брать квесты различных персонажей.. То тут уже проблема в том, что их поручения тоже не слишком интересные, хотя часть из них вполне забавная(боту К0п-аТелю здарова). Принеси, убей, подай, найди.. Вообщем ради галочки существуют ладно, вы даже можете не выполнять если п0хyй, болванчики относительно тоже самое чувствуют и в моменте когда город [Данные засекречены], и там да.. Они просто не придут торговать на той точке и всё. 
Теперь про сюжет.. Сюжет тут полный кринж от самого начала, как он начинается, и чем(в зависимости от выбора, но общая суть почти одинакова) заканчивается. Он по многим признакам, если не всем основным напоминает какое-то аниме, причём не самое хорошее или гейниальное, хотя сеттинг который разрабы сами выбрали к игре (Sci-Fi постапокалипсис) очень даже интересный ёмб твою.. Я хоть похожих примеров не знаю под скай-фай именно. Но даже в Сталкере и Ex Machina/HTA он пизже. Ну правда за последнюю игру лучше не упоминать, что разрабы не той дорогой тоже пошли... однако то не суть важно к самому Стеллару. Я бы ОЧЕНЬ хотел рассказать какой-нибудь конкретный пример, почему эта игра имеет признаки аниме, но не буду же самому себе пи3деть что без спойлеров.. Ладно, можно упомянуть что по концептам артам и внешности персов(1), и то что диалоги в целом не имеют сильной глубины и рассуждений(2). Особенно на моменте когда ""узнают правду"", их не сильно интересует допустим почему жерстянные банки которые разбросала одна шлюха вообще целые, когда по миру Ева видели кучу трупов своих коллег-бойцов? Нах надо да, типа, прописывать нормально реплики с учётом происходящего по миру контекста.. И это я вспомнил такой, довольно с натяжечко-жидкий пример, а там есть х-ня и более очевидная но я уже этот обзор пишу 2 часа подряд потому так не вспомню. Есть ещё третий(3) пример, который уже как ""сова на Глобус"" но в целом имеет место быть. Это в городе Ксион есть челы-революционеры местные, с агитками, собственной одеждой и даже 1 подманивает к себе в ловушку но ловят пізды. Причём максимально чисто ещё с Vergil Motivation референсом, когда Адам разносит всех за кадром как сигма(нет) и забирает андроида на борт.. и на этом всё, сила революционеров кончается. Может это уже комплекс какой-то, но я вообще-то думал, что можно было бы вступить на их сторону, и вместе сражаться ""За свою правду"". Но то уже скорее, нюанс фантомного упущенного калтента, что не слишком ввяжется с тем что начинал, почему сюжет анимешный кал. 
Про остальные пункты можно было бы всколзь упомянуть, но пожалуй, я лучше оставлю эти нюансы при себе + может, если захочу про это сделать полноценный видос. Но этого никогда не будет, игра 60-ти долларовый кринж для меня лично. Надо было не байтиться на ж0пу и этот псиопс что тут красивая героиня и всё.. ладно, время вспять не вернуть.

"Where to begin?

Essential parts of most Sims games are missing behind a paywall, I was one of the unlucky few to actually pay for this game before it went free and it was one kick in the teeth for a lover of The Sims.

Character customisation is very lacking and their is no gradients or hair highlights, only very simplistic within the base vanilla game. The only way to play this game is modded because the vanilla is stupidly expensive as EA decided to milk this cow dry with as many small packs as they could think of. Very disappointing when you consider that other games would have grouped these DLC's into one however the fans still pay so they will carry on making more minor expensive DLC. Buy and download the Sims 2, it might be missing key DLC but it's a more complete experience than this dumpster fire, and to think they keep releasing more dull and easy content because people still pay. For the price, Inzoi is a much better sims esque game and a much more complete experience. It's 2025 and EA is still very much EA.

EA, it's not in the game. They are more ruthless than an Indian tech scammer and almost as shameless. 
Looking at you First Pet DLC that apparently isn't part of the full price Pets DLC Because that's now just Cats & Dogs.",-0.046589147286821696,1752868338,False,1222670

"The Sims 4 — это популярный симулятор жизни от Maxis/EA, который за годы обновлений превратился в полноценную платформу для виртуального творчества. Игра дарит массу возможностей для самовыражения, но не лишена недостатков.

👍 Что нравится:
✅ Гибкость в создании персонажей – один из лучших в серии редактор внешности (CAS) с детальной настройкой черт лица и тела.
✅ Удобное строительство – режим строительства (Build Mode) стал интуитивнее, с системой перетаскивания комнат и умным размещением объектов.
✅ Много дополнений – за годы вышло десятки DLC (от «Времен года» до «Жизни в университете»), значительно расширяющих геймплей.
✅ Моды и кастомизация – огромная библиотека пользовательского контента (CC) делает игру практически бесконечной.
✅ Оптимизация – работает даже на слабых ПК, в отличие от Sims 3.

👎 Что разочаровывает:
❌ Оскоплённая база – без DLC игра кажется пустой (нет базовых вещей вроде погоды или домашних животных).
❌ Поверхностные эмоции – система настроений (Emotions) упрощена по сравнению с Sims 3.
❌ Откровенно слабые DLC – некоторые дополнения («Путешествие на Батуу») выглядят как наспех сделанный контент.
❌ Однообразный игровой процесс – без модов или собственной фантазии быстро наступает рутина.
❌ Дороговизна – полная коллекция с DLC стоит огромных денег.

💡 Кому подойдёт?
✔ Творческим людям – тем, кто любит строить дома и создавать персонажей.
✔ Казуальным игрокам – для расслабленного геймплея без сложных механик.
✔ Фанатам серии – несмотря на недостатки, это всё ещё увлекательный симулятор жизни.

⚖️ Альтернативы:
The Sims 3 (глубже, но хуже оптимизирована).

Paralives (ещё не вышел, но обещает быть конкурентом).

RimWorld / Stardew Valley (если хочется больше стратегии/фермерства).

🎯 Итог:
The Sims 4 — хорошая, но не идеальная игра. Она отлично подходит для творчества и неспешного отдыха, но без DLC и модов быстро приедается.

Оценка: 7.5/10
(8/10 – с любимыми дополнениями, 6/10 – базовая версия).

💡 Совет: Если хотите попробовать – лучше дождаться распродажи или подписки EA Play. Покупать все DLC сразу – дорого и не всегда оправдано.",0.0,1752863561,True,1222670

"Reforger is not Arma.

It's a shooter based on Arma.
It's like a more simplifed Squad in terms of direct combat.
There is no AI at all. The most the bots can do is appear around a point and defend it, just moving and shooting.
There are few vehicles in the basic version. Battles are only fought in motorized units - jeeps with machine guns, trucks and one transport helicopter, that's all there is.
Of course there is some mods available, but still..
Because it's already clear - the whole point is only in multiplayer servers and playing with people. Especially if it's a big server on a big map.
I got the ""editor"" - you edit the mission and actions in real time.
Like Zeus from A3. And the AI is very severely cut, to the level of infantilism.

In general,
Reforger can be cool if you have someone to play with. Especially when it comes to randoms.
But this is precisely a ""demo"" of the engine, not the game. The engine is cool, no questions.
But I don't understand why they ask so much for an ""engine test"" with such a minimum of content.
I think modding studios are switching to Refprger only in order to port to ARMA 4 in the future and work in this ecosystem.

The game (basic “conflict” pvp mode) much less friendly to «lone” players (when you can’t find IRL group in current circumstances) than HLL or Squad or many popular PvP scenarios from A3, Even modded servers use “conflict” as barebone just adding content over it. I don't like what BIS offers at all with that mode
if I wanted what they offer, I would rather go play some Foxhole.
That's why I haven't played it much and also because it is too early for decent single and coop scenarios even to get transport you have to coordinate with the whole team..
No MHQ/rally points or FOB for you and I can’t even see my squad on map, so what is the point?

Also there is also mod download problem in my region, it sometimes won’t download or gave errors after connection to server. Current workshop infrastructure is weak point.
Current performance/optimiazation state is much worse than A3 does now.

"One of the most infuriating pieces of dlc I've ever played. Simultaneously an expression of how far FromSoft has come in their skills developing an expanded open world and a frustrating slog that seems determined to test your patience at every turn. A good chunk of it is on the harder side of the base games balance, which isn't all that bad. Once you start getting into the meat of it however, it seems like the developers took some issue with the idea the base game isn't that difficult outside of the end game and decided wasting your time was the right way to achieve a difficulty that would shut people up. Where the base game keeps mobs pretty simple to dispatch and saves the challenge for bosses and dungeon/ puzzle navigation, the dlc has made every encounter a drawn out duel or a curb-stomp in your favor with little in between.  Overlong attack chains, frequent health sponges, inconsistent/ nonexistent ability to stagger the enemy while their poise carries them through almost all your attacks, high resistance to most damage types which limits the effectiveness of most/ making some useless, and a dozen other small things that take the dlc from being an additional challenge and pleasant send off to a time sink that forgets it still has to have respect for the players limited time in this world. Everything in the base game and dlc are beatable. You, prospective player, can make it every step of the way with some patience and understanding. But how many deaths, how many hours, how much grinding is too much for YOU, specifically? Because if it doesn't click, if you're not one of the few people who think the dlc is just as hard as it should be, you will come to hate it and burned $40 for the knowledge. I've been playing Fromsoft games since DS1. DS2 is the only one so far to completely deflect me and I won't act like it's entirely on the game for that; but i bring this up to say that I want to love this dlc like the rest of my FromSoft experience and I can't. The map design is amazing, the art direction is on point, the improved enemy ai can give you some tight and satisfying encounters, and the writing maintains a solid level of intrigue in what is happening in the land of shadow. But all of this falls flat after the honeymoon and you realize it has little respect for your time. Maybe respecting that made the base game ""too easy"", but i think I'd rather believe the game could be a little harder than blow $20-$40 so I can slowly boil over into frustration for hours.",-0.0989604591836735,1752885819,False,2778580
"Genuinely one of the best DLC's I've ever played, brought me back to the magic of the original game.

They added extra challenge & mechanics some didn't like but I honestly loved the exploration-based progression. The story (for me) rivals the main game and has some amazing twists. The characters may be my favorite part, Leda in particular became one of my favorite Fromsoft characters.

Strongly recommend if you enjoyed the base game.",0.21342592592592596,1752871135,True,2778580

"Je suis atrocement déçu par leur décision de mettre en vente des points d’apprentissage. J’ai joué pendant très longtemps des MMOs, peu m’ont tenu en haleine dans leur capacité à faire un monde persistent ou peut coexister le PVE et le PVP… Albion faisait partie de la liste, jusqu’à hier.

Je veux comprendre qu’ils aient peut-être des problèmes d’argent, mais dans un jeu ou TOUT est fait par les joueurs, mettre en ventre les points d’apprentissage n’est pas juste accélérer un processus. Mêler cela au système de Premium (qui allait je trouve) mènera à du PVP ou le portefeuille va être l’arme forte, ce qui mènera ceux qui veulent avoir une suprématie (après tout, on pouvait déjà acheter de l’or, qui permettait d’acheter de l’argent), à accepter dans leurs guildes d’autres qui vont aller utiliser le portefeuille par commodité parce qu’ils veulent gagner, ce qui n’est pas un mal mais qui n’aura rien de méritant et c’est tout le jeu qui va mourir.  
Je déconseille ce jeu, tant qu’ils ne seront pas revenus sur leur décision, désigner le responsable de la mise à mal d’une des meilleurs jeu en ligne cross-play / cross-platform pour éviter qu'il prenne un décision désastreuse dans ce domaine, ce jeu et n'importe quel autre à l'avenir.

"ENG:
Previously known as Red Falls, Helping the Hotties sees our protagonist (name of player's choice), a college psychology student, enjoying summer vacation with his girlfriend Jane, but after a warm welcome home for Jane upon her return, he receives an unexpected phone call from Dr. Eve Daniels, who urgently calls him to the Red Falls Behavioral Rehab Camp due to the camp being understaffed.
Already used to the environment and the staff, we are forced to ditch our eager girlfriend to come to the aid of Eve and her assistants Kiara and Ashely () with the new batch of patients arriving at the camp, but what we don't know is that the camp is no longer all-male and that the four new arrivals are all girls!
We will thus get to know the narcissistic Naomi, the shy and awkward Violet, the decidedly nymphomaniac Belle and the extravagant, yet funny and likeable, but still crazy, Stacy.

This second title by xRed Games is a multiple choice visual novel in which decisions have a certain weight in determining which events we will witness throughout the adventure. The player is also given the choice to enable the sandbox mode as well as the, fortunately few, minigames depending on the preferences. The adventure is also accompanied by a series of ""accessory missions"" and a hunt for collectibles, specifically the girls' panties, to unlock additional images in the gallery. Furthermore, as already seen in some titles by Inceton Games, such as Lust Theory, here too, on predetermined occasions, we will have the opportunity to both activate X-ray vision to see the girls without clothes and to change the camera angle during certain dialogues.
After an initial ""spurt"", the adventure slows down significantly and for much of the rest of the story there will be more occasions in which the protagonist will be ""teased"" than those in which the real ""action"" will take place, however, thanks also to the peculiarities listed above, entertainment should not be lacking.

On a technical level, the soundtrack, animations and models are very well done, even if the latter are, at least to my eye, quite similar to each other, in fact, with the exception of Jane, Eve and ""something"" of Violet, the girls are a bit difficult to distinguish by shape and size, so complexion, hair and voice play are the greatest help to recognize them when they do not have clothes.
However, if visually they resemble each other, in terms of personality and development they are all quite distinct, thanks also to a good professional dubbing that gives them further uniqueness, especially Stacy.




____


ITA:
Precedentemente noto come Red Falls, Helping the Hotties vede il nostro protagonista (nome a scelta del giocatore), uno studente di psicologia al college, in procinto di godersi le vacanze estive con la sua fidanzata Jane, tuttavia, dopo un ""caldo bentornato"" riservato a quest'ultima al suo rientro, il nostro riceve una telefonata inaspettata dalla dottoressa Eve Daniels, la quale lo convoca d'urgenza al campo di riabilitazione comportamentale Red Falls, perché a corto di personale.
Già avvezzi all'ambiente e al personale, ci vediamo costretti a piantare in asso la nostra procace fidanzata per accorrere in aiuto a Eve e alle sue assistenti Kiara e Ashely () con la nuova tornata di pazienti in arrivo al campo, quello che non sappiamo però è che questo non è più esclusivamente maschile e che le quattro nuove arrivata sono tutte ragazze!
Faremo così conoscenza con la narcisista Naomi, la timida e impacciata Violet, la decisamente ninfomane Belle e la stravagante, ma divertente e simpatica, ma pur sempre pazza, Stacy.

Questo secondo titolo di xRed Games è una visual novel a scelta multipla nella quale le decisioni hanno un certo peso nel determinare quali eventi andremo ad assistere nel corso dell'avventura. Al giocatore è pure data la scelta se abilitare la modalità sandbox così come anche i, fortunatamente pochi, minigiochi a seconda delle preferenze. L'avventura è anche accompagnata da una serie di ""missioni accessorie"" e una caccia ai collezionabili, nello specifico le mutandine delle ragazze, per sbloccare immagini aggiuntive nella galleria, inoltre, come già visto in alcuni titoli di Inceton Games, come ad esempio Lust Theory, anche qui, in predeterminate occasioni, avremo l'opportunità sia di attivare la visione a raggi X per vedere le ragazze senza vestiti che quella di cambiare angolazione della telecamera durante certi dialoghi.
Dopo un'""impennata"" iniziale, la vicenda subisce un rallentamento significativo e per parecchio del resto della storia saranno più le occasioni in cui il protagonista verrà ""stuzzicato"" che quelle in cui si passerà all'""azione"" vera e propria, tuttavia, grazie anche alle peculiarità elencate sopra, l'intrattenimento non dovrebbe comunque mancare.

A livello tecnico, colonna sonora, animazioni e modelli sono molto ben fatti, anche se questi ultimi risultano, almeno al mio occhio, un tantino simili tra loro, infatti, con l'eccezione di Jane, Eve e ""qualcosa"" di Violet, le ragazze sono un po' difficili da distinguere per forme e dimensioni, quindi carnagione, capelli e voce giocano sono l'aiuto maggiore per riconoscerle quando non hanno i vestiti.
Tuttavia, se visivamente si somigliano, a livello di personalità e di sviluppo sono tutte piuttosto distinte, grazie anche ad un buon doppiaggio professionale che conferisce loro ulteriore unicità, in particolare a Stacy.

Nota personale: una lotta serrata, che per me vede Naomi trionfare come best girl, anche se purtroppo ha poche scene, seguita da Kiara, Belle, poi Eve, che recupera tutto sul finale, Stacy, il cui accento mi stuzzica piacevolmente, Emily, che è simpatica, ma si limita per lo più alle buone intenzioni senza strafare, e Violet, che non ha colpe, ma non so perché non mi stimola se non per simpatia.
Jane l'avrei messa dopo Eve perché a ""lato pratico"" si comporta molto bene, ma si prende solo una menzione d'onore perché è fonte di più di un dramma non necessario e il motivo per cui il protagonista decide di ""stare a digiuno"" per un sacco di tempo, inoltre, visti i suoi messaggi (, poteva essere pure lei una delle pazienti, o addirittura poteva essere rimossa per consentire un inizio più ""vivace"", magari passando la sua scena, e le sue forme, a Belle, Kiara o addirittura Emily.",0.08926420801420804,1752978922,True,1590730

"Before speaking on anything else, I think theres way too much hate for this DLC. It has loads of content and is not significantly different from the base game.

However, if Elden ring is a 10/10 I'd give SOTE an 8.5/10. First of all, some specific areas do feel a bit more empty than others (The Cerulean Coast and Charo's Hidden Grave, as well as the Abyssal Woods). There are also one or two areas in the map that look explore-able upon first glance but aren't accessible, which can throw you off since there aren't any ""empty spots"" on the map in the base game. (the area south of the Discussion Chamber is empty space and its very misleading). 

Second of all, the difficulty. This is a plus or minus depending on the person, and while you technically have infinite preparation for any boss, almost every single boss you fight in this game does a massive amount of health whilst you do very little damage in return. Even if you are levelled appropriately, and have the correct amount of Scadutree Blessings, the DLC is noticeably harder than the base game.

Third of all, the final boss [spoiler]Consort Radahn[/spoiler]. This somewhat ties into my second point about the difficulty. The attack patterns of all the bosses in the DLC feel balanced. This is NOT the same for the final boss. It's extremely hard to hit him, the whole fight is basically a test of will. ""Oops, I got too greedy and died again"" x20

Dodging his attacks is extremely inconsistent in his second phase due to the uneven ground, so even if you dodge him perfectly it is a hit or miss. His [spoiler](Miquella's)[/spoiler] hair is extremely long and blocks your screen so you can't see anything he's doing. He's extremely laggy due to all of his unnecessary projectiles. His attacks are un-intuitive and hard to read. If he hits you then you will get staggered into oblivion, you are EXTREMELY punished for getting hit.

And finally, the worst part, he's just plain unfun. The devs basically just slap you on the ass like a donkey and say ""run left"" because that is his whole strat. If you run right you will die. If you dodge into him you will die. If you dodge away from him you will die. You have to circle left the ENTIRE fight. I can tell the difference between a skill issue and a badly made boss. I beat him after 4-ish hours and I'm good with never fighting him again. Mind you, this is POST nerf and he is still significantly harder to fight than Malenia. [spoiler]I also wish they created an entirely new boss instead of just bringing back Radahn.[/spoiler]

Fourth of all, the cutscene blueballs you. It's a 5 second cutscene and there's nothing particularly special about it. It didn't feel like there was much effort put into the final cutscene at all.

As a summary, it's a great DLC. I think people talk smack about the DLC because it's almost impossible to live up to the base game of Elden Ring. Messmer is one of my favorite bosses. The Shadow Keep is incredibly fun to explore. It's beautiful, and an interesting concept. I'll bitch about the final boss but it's literally one boss in the entirety of the DLC which is full of fun and intuitive bosses to fight. If the final boss turns you off from the DLC, buy it anyways and skip him and you won't be missing out on much. Same goes for the ""empty"" map. There was a couple areas that were slightly boring to explore, but in the end I still had fun.",-0.0448215621826733,1752978970,True,2778580

"Kenshi can oddly be summarized as Morrowind, if you removed all of the quests from the game, replaced every cliff racer with daedric enemies, and then add in awful performance that cause constant loading screens from running around the map alongside bugs and other issues that will delete half of your base, get your characters killed or even remove them entirely, break your saves outright and sometimes just crash your game when trying to load a save. It's unfortunately a deceptively shallow game that is held together with rubber bands. 

There is a lot going on in the World of Kenshi according to dialogue from its inhabitants, but in reality its all barren and artificial. There are several different factions that have their own issues and conflicts but they are all confined to their own little bubbles and will never reach out beyond them unless you force them too, which just results in a few different npcs spawning in different areas. You can run around and explore the handful of towns spread out across this very large, dead world, and all you'll find are npcs that are flagged to fight other npcs and a few unique characters with barely a paragraphs worth of dialogue. You can interact with all of these happenings by getting beat up by bandits, or trading items that can't be used by npcs to merchants who, in the non existent economy, restock their wallet and inventory every day, or sneak around and steal from said merchants, and that's really it. There are copy and pasted ruins to find with items tailored for the tech tree research and junk that can't be used for anything other than selling, but otherwise nothing interesting to find. No underground arenas to participate in, no local attractions to sight see, no gathering of nobility to make fun of the poor, nor any grand cathedrals with altars for the pious to grovel beneath. Just more desert and more towns filled nearly identical shops and inns.

Engaging with these few activities Kenshi has to offer isn't that meaningful either. The game functions mostly like an RTS so everything plays itself with the only real input from the player being minor positioning and kiting which isn't even that necessary. This creates a very boring gameplay loop that overstays its welcome due to the slow and one dimensional ways to level up your characters. Leveling up any of your characters major skills in combat, crafting, etc. will take dozens of hours if you don't explicitly focus on grinding them and have other priorities than just fighting the locals, or crafting the same cheap gear while you sit on your phone or fight the games performance issues trying to do other in game tasks. You could circumvent the grind by amassing a large number of people, but then comes the issue of annoying micromanaging of inventories, hunger and combing over everyone to check their health. Really the only thing left is the base building side of the game, but that highlights the abysmal ai pathfinding with characters getting stuck on rocks, phasing through walls and getting stuck, or just not doing anything because a small box in the back corner of the room is blocking them from entering the building at all, or the rudimentary job system causing logistical standstills with your workers just not doing things sometimes.

There is charm in its ideas and passion behind its creation, but Kenshi, devoid of the abstract, is just a mechanical and technical mess that feels like its wasting your time by pretending its ambition and scope are reality while gating the meaningful and interesting content with a tedious grind that prevent's you from fully experiencing the world presented and hiding most of it in nooks and crevices that blend in with identical ruins and lifeless structures.",-0.03795961422543703,1752877274,False,233860

"🎮 1.7 hours played // Review: 👍 Far Cry 5 — A wild ride through bugs, cults, and “Wait, what just happened?” moments

Far Cry 5 kicks off with more cutscenes than I have patience for.
I swear, I spent half the game watching characters talk at me like I’m supposed to remember all their names before I even get to shoot anything.
Spoiler: I don’t.

🎬 Intro cutscenes:
If you want to learn about cults, small-town drama, and how to get kidnapped 17 times in a row, you’re in luck!
But if you want to actually play the game, better grab popcorn and settle in.

🐞 Bugs:
Far Cry 5 has more bugs than a summer picnic.
NPCs get stuck in walls, cars mysteriously explode for no reason, and I once saw a cultist walk through a tree like it was a doorway.
The wildlife? Oh, they sometimes decide to float midair or perform the latest breakdancing moves.

🔫 Gameplay:
When the game finally lets you shoot, it’s a blast — literally and figuratively.
Nothing like sneaking up on a cult compound only to have a deer randomly pop out and knock you down. Thanks, nature.

Final Verdict: 7/10 – Great game, if you can survive the cutscene marathon and occasional glitchy wildlife disco.

P.S. If you haven’t been stuck inside a rock or had a dog decide you’re its best friend mid-fight, you’re missing out.

"ENG:
Previously known as Red Falls, Helping the Hotties sees our protagonist (name of player's choice), a college psychology student, enjoying summer vacation with his girlfriend Jane, but after a warm welcome home for Jane upon her return, he receives an unexpected phone call from Dr. Eve Daniels, who urgently calls him to the Red Falls Behavioral Rehab Camp due to the camp being understaffed.
Already used to the environment and the staff, we are forced to ditch our eager girlfriend to come to the aid of Eve and her assistants Kiara and Ashely () with the new batch of patients arriving at the camp, but what we don't know is that the camp is no longer all-male and that the four new arrivals are all girls!
We will thus get to know the narcissistic Naomi, the shy and awkward Violet, the decidedly nymphomaniac Belle and the extravagant, yet funny and likeable, but still crazy, Stacy.

This second title by xRed Games is a multiple choice visual novel in which decisions have a certain weight in determining which events we will witness throughout the adventure. The player is also given the choice to enable the sandbox mode as well as the, fortunately few, minigames depending on the preferences. The adventure is also accompanied by a series of ""accessory missions"" and a hunt for collectibles, specifically the girls' panties, to unlock additional images in the gallery. Furthermore, as already seen in some titles by Inceton Games, such as Lust Theory, here too, on predetermined occasions, we will have the opportunity to both activate X-ray vision to see the girls without clothes and to change the camera angle during certain dialogues.
After an initial ""spurt"", the adventure slows down significantly and for much of the rest of the story there will be more occasions in which the protagonist will be ""teased"" than those in which the real ""action"" will take place, however, thanks also to the peculiarities listed above, entertainment should not be lacking.

On a technical level, the soundtrack, animations and models are very well done, even if the latter are, at least to my eye, quite similar to each other, in fact, with the exception of Jane, Eve and ""something"" of Violet, the girls are a bit difficult to distinguish by shape and size, so complexion, hair and voice play are the greatest help to recognize them when they do not have clothes.
However, if visually they resemble each other, in terms of personality and development they are all quite distinct, thanks also to a good professional dubbing that gives them further uniqueness, especially Stacy.




____


ITA:
Precedentemente noto come Red Falls, Helping the Hotties vede il nostro protagonista (nome a scelta del giocatore), uno studente di psicologia al college, in procinto di godersi le vacanze estive con la sua fidanzata Jane, tuttavia, dopo un ""caldo bentornato"" riservato a quest'ultima al suo rientro, il nostro riceve una telefonata inaspettata dalla dottoressa Eve Daniels, la quale lo convoca d'urgenza al campo di riabilitazione comportamentale Red Falls, perché a corto di personale.
Già avvezzi all'ambiente e al personale, ci vediamo costretti a piantare in asso la nostra procace fidanzata per accorrere in aiuto a Eve e alle sue assistenti Kiara e Ashely () con la nuova tornata di pazienti in arrivo al campo, quello che non sappiamo però è che questo non è più esclusivamente maschile e che le quattro nuove arrivata sono tutte ragazze!
Faremo così conoscenza con la narcisista Naomi, la timida e impacciata Violet, la decisamente ninfomane Belle e la stravagante, ma divertente e simpatica, ma pur sempre pazza, Stacy.

Questo secondo titolo di xRed Games è una visual novel a scelta multipla nella quale le decisioni hanno un certo peso nel determinare quali eventi andremo ad assistere nel corso dell'avventura. Al giocatore è pure data la scelta se abilitare la modalità sandbox così come anche i, fortunatamente pochi, minigiochi a seconda delle preferenze. L'avventura è anche accompagnata da una serie di ""missioni accessorie"" e una caccia ai collezionabili, nello specifico le mutandine delle ragazze, per sbloccare immagini aggiuntive nella galleria, inoltre, come già visto in alcuni titoli di Inceton Games, come ad esempio Lust Theory, anche qui, in predeterminate occasioni, avremo l'opportunità sia di attivare la visione a raggi X per vedere le ragazze senza vestiti che quella di cambiare angolazione della telecamera durante certi dialoghi.
Dopo un'""impennata"" iniziale, la vicenda subisce un rallentamento significativo e per parecchio del resto della storia saranno più le occasioni in cui il protagonista verrà ""stuzzicato"" che quelle in cui si passerà all'""azione"" vera e propria, tuttavia, grazie anche alle peculiarità elencate sopra, l'intrattenimento non dovrebbe comunque mancare.

A livello tecnico, colonna sonora, animazioni e modelli sono molto ben fatti, anche se questi ultimi risultano, almeno al mio occhio, un tantino simili tra loro, infatti, con l'eccezione di Jane, Eve e ""qualcosa"" di Violet, le ragazze sono un po' difficili da distinguere per forme e dimensioni, quindi carnagione, capelli e voce giocano sono l'aiuto maggiore per riconoscerle quando non hanno i vestiti.
Tuttavia, se visivamente si somigliano, a livello di personalità e di sviluppo sono tutte piuttosto distinte, grazie anche ad un buon doppiaggio professionale che conferisce loro ulteriore unicità, in particolare a Stacy.

Nota personale: una lotta serrata, che per me vede Naomi trionfare come best girl, anche se purtroppo ha poche scene, seguita da Kiara, Belle, poi Eve, che recupera tutto sul finale, Stacy, il cui accento mi stuzzica piacevolmente, Emily, che è simpatica, ma si limita per lo più alle buone intenzioni senza strafare, e Violet, che non ha colpe, ma non so perché non mi stimola se non per simpatia.
Jane l'avrei messa dopo Eve perché a ""lato pratico"" si comporta molto bene, ma si prende solo una menzione d'onore perché è fonte di più di un dramma non necessario e il motivo per cui il protagonista decide di ""stare a digiuno"" per un sacco di tempo, inoltre, visti i suoi messaggi (, poteva essere pure lei una delle pazienti, o addirittura poteva essere rimossa per consentire un inizio più ""vivace"", magari passando la sua scena, e le sue forme, a Belle, Kiara o addirittura Emily.",0.08926420801420804,1752978922,True,1590730

"Honestly I had some high hopes for this game. I want to start off by saying there are zero technical issues with this game. Probably one of the few really solid performing games right out of the gate. No crashes, no glitches, nothing that I have found to credit the game with anything other than stellar performance. Beautiful graphics and some interesting weapon choices but not much more than that.
As to game play, this is where the game falls down. You will quickly realize that the entire games is the same all the way through. I thought there could be some serious story in the game and it 'appears' that way but when you actually start playing after a cut scene it is just the same run and gun all the way through. More baddies, bigger baddies, more combination of baddies, but its all really just the same. I have only played about 18 hours of game time and I find it hard to want to sit down and play the game because I know the game is shallow and doesn't present anything to keep me intrigued or want to learn and play more. If you just want run and gun over and over then maybe this game is for you but it isn't for me.

"Great visual atmosphere, really unique OST, and great use of mystery to make events scary. Something in the dark, the colony or inside one of you.

Anomaly changes the balance of Core Rimworld and all other DLCs, because you come out far more powerful from when you went in. The rest of the game doesn't seem ""prepared"" for you post-Anomaly.
Anomaly is played separately from the rest of the game, a self contained ""island"". It takes over the playthrough once it starts.

"Я бы назвал это плохим длс, но оглядываясь назад на новое дополнение здесь все не так уж плохо.
Плюсы:
-Новый геймплей. Вы создаёте камеры для содержания тварей , что бы создать новые пушки против органики (почти все аномалии дополнения), генераторы на новом ресурсе биоферите что можно автоматизировать .
-Новые угрозы. Кроме обычных болванчиков  заменяющих рейдеров, можно испытать опыт около амонг-ас и мафии где предатель- металлическая жуть, идеологический противник золотой куб, что будет ставить в палки в колёса , но давать хорошее настроение(может не так уж и плохо)
-новые возможности абуза игры, клонирование пешек, мутации конечностей, а также куча окультных ритуалов.
Минусы:
-Длс активно берет одеяло на себя.На вас всё ещё будут нападать культисты и твари за просто наличие длс активным. а средств против них у вас вряд-ли будет
-Биошматы, а именно генетическая мутация белки и зайца Пальцешип- быстрее гепарда, стукает больно и их бывает очень много в угрозах.А , и да, биошматы появляются в древнем зле.
-~70% новых угроз это рейдеры болванки с 1 особеностью и рескином. Зомби дерутся до конца. Химеры- медведи что разгоняются после получения урона.

Итог: длс перетягивает на себе одеяло большинство геимплея игры, но дает уникальные предметы и действия. Но не исследовать дл , но оставлять его включённым - глупо, если вы не планируете даже биоферит добывать на пушки.

"I love playing rimworld don't get me wrong and I love the idea of adding horror, and yes it's cool to effectively be a 'cult' that doesn't just eat prisoners, but can actually believe in something genuinely evil.

However, there is a major problem with Rimworld Anomaly that is horribly glaring. It doesn't mix well with the base-game or modded. Unlike Ideology, Biotech, and the recent introduction of Odyssey, this adds only one new way of setting up a colony and 'build.' So much so that this dlc probably ranks alongside Royalty as the worst dlcs(and the price increase certainly doesn't help.)

(This needs to be said now, this review is going to start spoiling other dlcs including this one, and I will not be censoring them, you have been warned.)

Unlike the other dlcs: ideology, royalty, biotech, and odyssey you can passively experience some of the new additions freely without making a play through solely be about them. For example Royalty allows you to have psylinks and ultratech weapons without needing to have the imperial faction be in the game. Ideology adds more quests to entice you to loot and complete even without ideoligions, and has a really good long-term end game where you progressively have to restart with the same people. Biotech is by far the best in the fact that you never need to touch the mechanitor half, or even the xenogeneology, you just have more ability to customize and mod your play through to play as a custom alien/mutant race. Odyssey, which I still have to experience more of, and am currently playing as I write this review, also adds new quests and while the space aspect is very appealing, the new biomes and animals are equally enticing and interesting, (even if some of it seems to share aspect to preexisting mods weirdly enough), alongside the ability to access colonial shuttles which has been addressed in so many mods and lead to the development of one of the most annoyingly easy to bug yet slightly required to avoid annoying long walks: Vehicle Framework.

So what does anomaly add that the others don't? Effectively it just adds a new straight forward 'questline' with new events and that's about it. 

Well that sounds ok, in fact it also sounds like that's the whole point of the dl- WELL unfortunately alot of the events, enemies and encounters are also horribly balanced at times to the point that it's more of a chore to deal with them than a genuine challenge or 'horror.'

Let's start with the Fleshmass heart... the other flesh-monsters are cool, you find them in abandoned settlements, neat. When a hole gets dug beneath you and you have to venture down and collapse a cave by slaughtering their queen, sweet that's nice! And then the Flesh mass heart... this one suffers both from it's main mechanic and the fact that all of the events and anomalies are either not mentioned or 'spoilered.' When it spawns, you can't hurt it immediatly... you can carve your way to the center through a barrage of gunfire and an epic battle through fleshmass, slowly wittling down your troops as more fleshbeasts spawn and as their needs start to get more intense all the while the fleshmass seals around them... That sounds cool doesn't it. Now imagine doing it three times in quick secession in order to defeat the heart... YEAH! what you have to do is drill to the center, take the nerve sample... then wait a ingame day for another to spawn... then drill to the center, nerve sample.. then wait a ingame day for another to spawn... then drill to the center,.. and no more epic battle just click the 'kill' button and then it explodes... After this multi-day trial and tribulation of repeating the once glorious battle you thought was cool multiple times... what do you get? A ball that spawns the worst meat in the dlc every few days... Good news, it's helpful if you're using ghouls... problem, it's only really helpful if you're using ghouls... yes you can turn it to fuel but there is already oodles of passive ways to get chemfuel sustainably(Chem reactor, Boomalopes, wood, and insect/human meat.) Overall this is such a niche reward for such a horribly designed task, which sucks more considering that there is already probably a ton of fleshbeast corpses nearby leftover from your battle with the heart... Oh also, if you don't contain it enough it just creates another fleshmass heart and the cycle repeats again... 

This same 'wait until you have three and suffer' style of mechanic is not just by itself here. The grey flesh event is made to suck the most and for new players is going to punish you severely if you're not aware of it(which is annoying since it's not only part of a spoiler based dlc, but also not part of the book of anomalys directly. So when you first encounter it you have no clue what you're going up against and are forced to watch as your colonists instantly die from something you can't physically control without having experienced it before. This especially sucks because there is a way to 'detect' the enemy, which turns out to be a fucking 'fully metal creature growing in your pawns.' The problem is that the way to detect the enemy requires for several sample of 'grey flesh' to spawn, and then you can finally surgically inspect and successfully detect (and end up unleashing them early, so it's not even a 'nice I outsmarted them moment' it's just a 'fuck this, i couldn't do anything until now.') It's ridiculous to not be able to detect a fully metal structure inside a pawn, like... surely your medics could find 'hints' that someone could be infected, or maybe there's a thing that you manually have to watch and see the pawns do like specific 'suspicious behaviors' instead of no info whatsoever. And the worst part, when you finally do unleash the Metalhorrors, you're told exactly how it got transmitted, but even with that knowledge if there's more metalhorrors you're not given an advantage with any of that information besides the initial patient zero which is most likely obvious in most situations.

Speaking of patient zeros, most patient zeros involve the 'Creepjoiners' mechanic, which is the closest thing that the dlc has to a 'outside of the main questline mechanic' and they have some of the most basic coding. Basically an event will pop up where someone with a strange yet obvious demeanor approaches your colony and wants to talk... these 'creepjoiners' come to join you with one benefit, one unusal status and one negative effect. 

These benefits could include 'transmuting resources, instakilling enemies(which enemies can't use for balance reasons), healing spells, absurdly high skill ranks, or even no need bars for food, sleep or comfort.' Which can be helpful and still encourage a player to look at these unusual pawns with suspicion, and punish players who are too relaxed with letting a 'creep' join your colony willy nilly.

The drawbacks are also interesting including things as horrible as metalhorror infection to 'nothing.' However mixed in to that catergory is also a wide variety of awful coding. 

For one, the weakest drawback i have found is 'Desertion' which will just cause the pawn to randomly leave after a while, no real reason as to why, and this is so easy to counter that you can just capture and then recruit the pawn after it tries to leave. 'Organ Decay' follows the normal organ decay affliction HOWEVER it will also make the organs impossible to remove without killing the pawn, this means that if they naturally decay in a non-vital organ unlike normal pawns that have organ decay... they will just die... and recieve 9999 damage to their wounds, which kind of proves that the devs really wanted it to hurt, but don't mention this anywhere, not even the wiki mentions this yet. 

That is really all I have witnessed in the code spaghetti and it really ruins my experience when a pawn dies from something they really shouldn't, cause I hate to have dev-mode ready in the background. 

I would reccomend trying biotech or ideology instead.",0.049766367891367874,1752629391,False,2380740

При этом, бороться с этой чумой чрезмерно сложно: зомби имеют по 3000 hp каждый, при этом, после убийства ещё и возрождаются. Единственный возможный способ сдержать натиск - непрерывный отстрел, благо, зомбаря можно ""тормозить"" шквальным огнём орудия, чтобы хоть как-то его задержать до окончания времени. А время в такой суматохе длится вечно... Дико сложно, но в этом вся суть и драйв.

И по сути, эксперимент с контрой весьма безбашенный, к тому же за основу взята довольно-таки старенькая (и даже очень) версия контры на двигле GoldSource, причём взята даже не оригинальная кс 1.6, а корейская версия CS:O, что ещё больше взрывает мозг обычному обывателю сети. Исходя из вышесказанного, разрабы данного продукта на ГОДЫ опоздали с релизом. Следовательно, можно было реализовать тот же F2P на основе двигла Source, взяв хотя бы за основу базовую версию CS:S. С этим они, конечно, прогадали.

Однако, это не мешает многим играющим получать удовольствие от процесса игры. Сервера забиты практически до отвала, безумие и ситуационный тиммейт (особенно в режиме ""Побег зомби""), куча стволов и ещё больше зомби, причём зомбаком может стать абсолютно каждый, и наверняка станет.

Короче говоря, выбирайте сами, на чьей Вы стороне. В любом случае, Вы ничем не рискуете. Я не вложил ни копейки и успел трезво оценить свои первые впечатления. Выбор всегда за Вами.

"Depois do anúncio do remake, fiquei com bastante vontade de conhecer Persona 4, até então eu havia jogado o 5 e 3, mas sempre vi por aí muitas pessoas (muitas mesmo) dizendo como elas preferiam este jogo, sendo por seus personagens, história, música, vibes, etc. Depois de ter zerado, consigo entender completamente de onde todo esse amor vem, assim como os outros jogos da franquia, esse jogo tem aquele mesmo [u]carisma[/u] dos outros, sabe? Esse joghttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1113000/Persona_4_Golden/#o com certeza deixou uma marca em mim, assim como os outros deixaram.

Os personagens com certeza são o ponto mais alto desse jogo, todos os seus companheiros são bem presentes durante a história, e com exceção de um, todos são bem agradáveis de fazer os social links e assistir eles interagindo entre si, esse jogo inteiro passa uma vibe muito mais ''alegre'' do que todos os outros e você sente bastante isso em todo mundo. Eles tem bastante aquela energia de ''amizade boba de amigos de um anime de escola'' e mesmo que isso dava uma cansada em alguns pontos da história, eu ainda curti.

Dito isso, [spoiler]Meu Deus como eu fiquei de saco cheio do Teddie várias vezes. Acho que isso é simplesmente um estilo de humor que os japoneses gostam que não desce em mim, mas esse negócio de ficar, ''nossa, eu quero muito ver minhas amigas ficarem peladas e namorar com elas, haha!'' começa a encher o saco. Se fosse uma vez ou outra eu não veria problema, esses momentos fazem parte dos outros jogos também, mas depois de um tempo, parece que o Teddie só consegue abrir a boca pra falar disso, e as vezes ficava até pior já que o Yosuke entrava nessa pira junto. Depois da metade pro fim do jogo, eu só tava achando ele muito esquisitão do que qualquer outra coisa.[/spoiler] Bom, mas excluindo essa parte, gostei bastante dos personagens!

A história do jogo consegue te prende bastante, principalmente da metade pro fim, onde todas as peças do mistério começam a se encaixar, sempre que eu abria o jogo eu ficava naquela mini ansiedade pra saber o que iria acontecer em seguida, e adorei o antagonista principal, provavelmente meu personagem favorito do jogo inteiro!

Toda a estética do jogo no combate, nas músicas e quando você está só passeando na cidade construindo os social links é muito marcante, era muito normal eu simplesmente ficar balançando a cabeça no ritmo da música enquanto eu jogava. Quanto ao combate, joguei o jogo inteiro no difícil e foi um desafio bem agradável pra mim que sempre deixar os jogos um pouco mais difíceis que o normal, vencer os bosses principais era bem satisfatório.

Em geral, jogo muito bom! Entendo como esse foi o jogo que realmente colocou a Atlus no mapa e como ele conseguiu tocar tantas pessoas, se você jogou e gostou de ter jogado tanto o 3 quanto o 5, aqui tem tudo que você gosta!",0.16833333333333333,1752880187,True,1113000

"Most likely left to die, until probably the proverbial DLC, Dragon's Dogma 2 is a ca be a bit of a whimper. Carried solely by its combat and great graphics but falls quite far lore wise than expected.  On top of the weird performance issues, weird quest breaking that isn't fixable, since its an actual mechanic. 

DD2 leaves you wandering the history and scope of the world you travel in. Aside from the big quest, every side quest leaves you wanting more, and you never get it. Sometimes NPCs will show up to your house then ask you to walk them several miles across the entire map so they can give you a flower or some sh*t. please give me a ferrystone lol. 



What I did like was the exploration, but there isn't really anything to find out or anything of nuance that stays with the player. Caves feel terrifying, night even more so. 

After you reach a certain level every encounter is trivial at best. The use of light, elemental spells, are incredibly fun. The digging for materials? not fun. The story is almost there, you do cool things like meet up with the most beautiful character in gaming, dress up to sneak into a party, break into a jail but there's no stealth component so its just weird. 

NPCs are cut from the same cloth, never really say anything substantial or new. The same applies to your pawns, who ridiculously point out endlessly, that you need to read this notice on the wall, except its the same notice written, 4 hours before, and 100 hours before also.

What it does excel at is combat, and sometimes you get your ass handed to you after just powering through every encounter. The world is full of half realized ideas, there is so much here that could be found, but never is. 
The combat is great though, it feel quite good when you fight something tough. Kiting a troll or cyclops towards a bridge or into a pile of rocks. However this truly stops being unique or cool 30 hours in. The world is extremely pretty and the characters are really decent looking, just wished it had more to give. The class system is big, and includes a surprise one that really makes the game fun.

The AI of enemies is quite aggressive but not very tough after a certain point. Eventually, you will be running around or teleportation to avoid the same encounters, you'll go into this deep cave and find pretty useless gear half the time. I don't expect to strike rich every time but Jesus. I don't need them to be Dark Souls tough but overall I expected enemies to behave more erratically and unpredictably. 

What I do like is how it does not hold your hand, sometimes to a devastating extreme. Don't use an unique item, since it doesn't warn you you can only use it once. The character creator is GREAT however, depending on your build the armor can look absolutely awful, like cosplay. 

While I do think it is worth playing on a deep sale, the first year anniversary had no update, nothing new to add, the creator of it left capcom. We are sitting here still with no answers if any of the broken quests, npc's will be fixed or even adding some flair to your personal pawn to make him idk, less stupid and more quest useful. Overall, DD2 is not as lovable and interesting as the first one, considering we waited like 12 years for this sequel once that rose tinted glasses come off, it just disappointing.

Now: Should you play this game? Yeah. ""after all that you said?"" yeah. DD2 is a very rare game in a sea of soulslike and FPS. It has the right balance to where I do enjoy it even though I am criticizing it. I recommend waiting for a steep sale, and that your rig can run it.

What does this game need to make it better?
More performance optimizations.
More lore and make pawns actually useful when questing.
Obviously a DLC of some sort and not like ""collaborations""
Better armor design for custom Arisen that better fits their body type.

Overall this game is fun, but it can really punish you whether its your fault or not. It looks great, I still hate not being able to like, set ladders or something. Or like you pawn helping you by casting float. I will eventually fully finish it when we get a bit more fixes bc im almost there but didn't feel like walking to the end of the world to get another bouquet of flowers.",0.11354976841340478,1752878953,True,2054970

"Dragon’s Dogma 2 is one of those rare games that divides opinion. If it clicks with you, it might just become one of your all-time favorites. But if it’s not your thing, it could easily feel frustrating or tedious. I fell in love with the original years ago, and it’s still one of my favorite games ever. I’ve now finally completed the sequel – life got in the way at launch, but I made sure to come back to it.

From start to finish, you can feel the passion the developers poured into this world. Dragon’s Dogma 2 isn’t just another generic RPG – it’s crafted to be something special, something that values player freedom over hand-holding narratives. I spent around 60 hours just exploring before I even touched the main story. The moment the world opened up, I wandered off, chasing adventure wherever it led me. By the time I got around to the story, I was around level 40; by the time I faced the final boss, I was level 80 and obliterated him in a single strike. Sure, it was anticlimactic in one way – but it also felt completely earned, and honestly, a little funny.

And that wasn’t even the end. With the help of the mysterious “Dungeon Master” (= Pathfinder), I dove into the true ending – a final chapter that perfectly encapsulates what makes this game special. No markers, no guides – just you, your instincts, and the world. Without spoiling anything, I can say the true ending is a brilliant tribute and love letter to game design itself.

So, do I recommend Dragon’s Dogma 2? That depends on you. If you enjoy games like Dark Souls, where discovery and freedom take precedence, this might be exactly your style. If you prioritize engaging mechanics and exploration over deep storytelling, this could be a perfect fit. And if you’re simply looking for a game that feels genuinely unique, Dragon’s Dogma 2 is absolutely worth your time.

That said—if you don’t like having to figure things out yourself, or occasionally look things up online when you miss something crucial, this game probably isn’t for you. It expects you to get lost, to make mistakes, and to discover the world on your own terms. For the right player, that’s exactly the magic of it.",0.1914806547619048,1752874855,True,2054970

"[h3]The protagonist of this game is probably the son of Phoenix Wright and Larry Laffer, as he constantly engages in verbal battles with hot girls and, after winning, takes the girls to bed.[/h3]

[h1]✍️Overview [/h1]
Love n Life: Happy Student is a sandbox visual novel featuring comprehensive gameplay with playable elements from RPGs, dating simulators, time/resource management, and more.
In this game, you play as a third-year college student, who manage to be transfer to the prestigious Lingyun University. 
There, the protagonist hones his conversational social skills in ""fights"" with other students, using a system of equippable items that grant ""conversation topics.""
Moreover, through these ""battles,"" the protagonist will succeed in capturing the hearts (and bedrooms) of three captivating main heroines and another 3 side heroines, with whom he engages 28 different passionate encounters, most of which feature high-quality Live 2D animations and lewd SFX, ideal for a fulfilling nighttime manual labor session.

[h3]📜Story[/h3]
The narrative is certainly not this title's strong point. It has a fairly generic university harem background with heroines who have extremely flat, stereotypical personalities. For example, there is a cheerful blonde gyaru, a serious student council president, and a seductive, busty teacher. Characters that serve to satisfy different fetishes in the game, but not for a deep story.
The progression of the story is unremarkable as well. It features typical slice-of-life events where the protagonist attends classes, helps the heroines complete tasks, and goes on dates with them.
Therefore, it is generally better not to pay too much attention to the characters' dialogues and instead enjoy the gameplay and sexual content, which undoubtedly deserve more of your attention and time.

[h3]🎮Gameplay[/h3]
This title is visually quite similar to a sandbox visual novel, as it has different locations that you can “explore” and visit via a menu/mini-map. In these locations, you will find the different heroines, who will change places depending on the day and time, as the game borrows this from the time management genre, giving the characters a routine. In addition to the heroines, you can also find NPCs in these places, who can sell you things, offer the protagonist work, or be necessary to complete side missions.
As for the gameplay itself, it is mainly divided into two mechanics. The first is dating simulation, where you have to win the affection of the heroines by giving them gifts, going on dates with them, but mainly by completing their missions, which are the most typical, such as finding them in a specific place at a certain time, buying them an item, collecting materials, etc. Once you complete the missions, you unlock the different sex scenes.
The second playable part corresponds to the RPG section, as the protagonist has different statistics, such as: impact, stamina, fortitude, impact chance, awareness, and steadfastness, which are explained in the game, but which are basically the basis for the “combat” conversations that the protagonist has with different characters. These battles are completely automatic, and the player only has to assemble the protagonist's “build,” equipping objects that grant additional stats and active combat skills. There are a total of 359 different items, so there is a wide range of options, but basically their usefulness is reduced to four different types: charm, which is characterized by powerful attacks; knowledge, which is characterized by large increases but with the possibility of harming you; confidence, for having high levels of endurance; and finally, kindness, which is characterized by allowing you to heal yourself during combat.
This item system is what really adds complexity to the gameplay and, therefore, is what can keep you entertained as you try to put together a “build” that suits your style.
It is important to note that these conversational battles, or “socialize” as the game calls them, are necessary for certain events in the main story and for the heroines, so it is important to have a powerful build as the heroines' levels will increase, making the battles more complicated.

[h3]🔞Sexual content[/h3]
[h3]Note: You need to install the +18 Free DLC or you will not see any sexual content.[/h3]
In total, this game has 28 sex scenes, all of which have animations, although 15 of these are full HD Live 2D animations and the remaining 13 are simpler animations that use the in-game character models. Fortunately, in both cases, they feature erotic sound effects and some voice dialogue.
As for the quality of these scenes, the Live 2D animations are undoubtedly infinitely better, not only because they have higher quality art that can be appreciated in full screen, but also because the movements are quite fluid and realistic and, together with the atmosphere, music, and sound effects, are extremely suggestive. The animations that use the in-game models are not bad as such, since they also have fluid animations and add an internal view of the heroine's vagina so you can see the moment of ejaculation, but I still prefer the Live 2D. Although one point to note is that despite the quality of the scenes being good, their duration is quite short, lasting a maximum of one minute.
As for the sexual fetishes present, there is not much to highlight since most fall into the vanilla category, with blowjobs, boobjobs, vaginal sex, sex toys, threesomes, public sex, bikinis, and some cosplay. So while it is enjoyable content for all players, veterans of the genre may be left wanting more.
An important point to note is that in addition to the game having a scene gallery, it can be unlocked in its entirety if you play on the “FAP” difficulty setting, so you can enjoy the good erotic content right from the start, as soon as you finish the story tutorial.

[h2]💭Conclusion[/h2]
Personally, I like this game more than Reborn Entertainment's previous release, Love n Life: Lucky Teacher, because despite having a smaller map and fewer mini-games, the gameplay is more entertaining, strategic, and not as repetitive, plus the art is no longer done with AI and looks totally incredible.
As for the sexual content, I also think the Live 2D animations are totally awesome, so I would have liked all of them to be of this type, although I suppose that with 15 of these for a price of $7, it's still a good deal.
The most notable negative points I see in this game are undoubtedly its generic story and flat heroines. I would have liked them to add others that were less atypical or at least one that had an original story with deeper touches.
That said, I have no problem recommending this game because, despite its generic college harem setup, the quality of the sexual content, its “socialize” gameplay, and its price make it a good buy, especially if you want to have entertaining late-night manual labor sessions.

"JudgeSim, “Banana Republic” adlı kurgusal bir adada hakim rolüne büründüğünüz, metin tabanlı bir simülasyon oyunu. Davaları okuyor, delilleri inceliyor, sanıklarla konuşuyor ve hukuki kararlar veriyorsunuz.

Artılar:

    Sürükleyici davalar: Her vaka ilgi çekici ve dikkatli okuma, çözümleme gerektiriyor. Davalar metinle anlatıldığı için zihin gücü ön planda ve kararlar ciddi hissettiriyor .

    Tekrar oynanabilirlik: Farklı sonuçlara ulaşmak, yargılamalardaki farklı yolları keşfetmek tekrar etmek için motive ediyor .

    Minimalist atmosfer: Grafikler basit, ama bu metin odaklı oynanışa katkıda bulunuyor. Phoenix Wright kadar çarpıcı değil ama türünde başarılı
    Epic Games Store
    .

Eksiler:

    Monoton müzik: Müzikler kısa ve çabuk tekrara düşüyor; bazı kullanıcılar sıkıcı bulabiliyor .

    Şans faktörü: Bazen davaların ve ceza sonuçlarının tamamen zar atışına dayandığı anlar var ki bu, temelde beceriye dayalı yargılamayla çakışabiliyor .

    Basit görsel stil: Kağıt üzerinde hazırlanmış gibi duran grafikler, bazı oyunculara “Papers, Please” benzeri ama daha zayıf bir deneyim sunuyor.",0.1,1752703993,True,2919660

"aaaaaaa DLC:  Que complemento legal e maneiro de se jogar , alguns falaram em 10 horas de gameplay pra mim que joguei tranquilo durou pouco mais de 20hr so curtinho e admirando o game lindo, cenarios diferentes  que experiencia fodastica eu recomendo muito. Para quem gostou do jogo Base acha que a dlc nao vale a pena pelo preco sim esta salgada o valor mais eu compraria para mim presentiar se caso gostasse.

Sobre o GAME:  implementando novas armas , quest legais tambem. Oque eu achei mais fodastisco foi ter a volta ao passado suas descorbertas , A lea acho que foi uma peca bem legal entre todos do jogo bonita,estilosa e uma bela espreitadora , mas outra personagem me deixou intrigante no caso a Rosalia pelo que eu entendi ela vivia ou esteve presente por Krat mas como ela foi tomada por titeres nao durou muito , acredito que o passado ficou mais conectado com a historia principal do que o proprio jogo Base oque e claro em uma DLC simplesmente achei muito fodaaaa.
 As barracas de jogos,  as manilevas deixadas tambem acho que nao da pra passar batido esses detalhes pra quem quer curtir o jogo , sem ruchar e maraviloso obrigado Round8 e Neowiz Games que OBRA PRIMA!!! TOOOP DE MAISSSSSSS...

"Love the game but would love it more if there were a few adjustments to quality of life, these are just suggestions but would love to see them implemented. 

. Pal orbs not taking up inventory space

. Being able to move items without dismantling them

. i noticed when raiding npc bases that the pals and npcs wont easily go through doors, they will try to fight through the
 walls

. My character gets cold even though im in my base and near fire, would be nice if that could be fixed

.When i assign a pal to something they dont always go back to working on it after a break or base raid, not sure if this happens with everyone? maybe its just the position of my sites

. Being able to move the palbox and see the range of the blue circle so you can tell if all of your sites or structures are within the blue ring

.Being able to apply near wall/floors on top of one another when wanting to upgrade say from wood to stone etc instead of having to dismantle the structures and anything on it

.Pals prioritizing stacking same item like ore, in a container that already has it before putting it into another one? or maybe i just have things set up weird and they do that already, idk

.This one is just me being nit picky but havign your characters eyes actually close when sleeping.

"Unfinished Business is very, very solid game
Delivered the good RoboCop experience I had with Rogue City.

Pros:

The story is not bad

New mechanics and enemy types

You can play as Murphy before he became RoboCop

New finishers and the Ricochet ability are pretty sweet

You can pet animals

Cons:

Mouth movement sometimes freezes during cutscenes, making characters look like ventriloquists.

I encountered three bugs. One was particularly annoying — near the end, you lose your main weapon, and when you pick up a new one from the ground, the game doesn't let you switch it again. If you grab the wrong weapon, you can end up with no ammo and get stuck. I had to reload the area twice and ended up finishing the segment with just a shotgun.


Rating: 8/10 – A very solid addition to an already pretty good game. Didn’t disappoint.

"🌲 theHunter: Call of the Wild – Sessizlikte Av, Doğada Var Ol 🦌
Bu oyun seni bağırarak karşılamaz.
Sana sadece “dinle” der.
Kuş sesi, rüzgâr uğultusu, yaprak hışırtısı...
Ve sonra... o sesi duyarsın:
bir geyik homurtusu.
Ve artık nefes almak bile israftır.

🎯 Bu sadece hayvan vurma oyunu değil.
Bu, her adımı planlayan, her nefesi ölçen, her kurşunu sayan bir iç yolculuk.

Harita devasa,

Biyomlar şahane,

İz sürme sistemi gerçekçi.
Ama asıl güzellik: “Boşuna 1 saat yürümedim” dediğin o ilk başarılı atışta.

🛠️ Av tüfekleri, dürbünler, tuzaklar, çağırıcılar...
Hepsi seni doğayla uyumlu hale getirmek için var.
Bu oyunda Rambo gibi dalan kaybeder;
göl kenarında 15 dakika sabit durabilen kazanır.

🦌 Avladığın hayvanlar sadece hedef değil.
Her biri detaylı, gerçekçi davranışlara sahip.
Bir geyik seni duyar kaçarsa, 2 saatlik emek gider.
Ama o avı düzgün takip edip kalbine tek atışla indirirsen...
Bir “avcı gururu” çöküyor üstüne.
Ve o an, bütün sessizlik boşa gitmemiş oluyor.

🧭 Gündoğumu manzarası, yağmur altındaki orman, sisin içindeki silüet...
Hepsi birer tablo gibi.
Ama senin görevin o tablonun içine girip, düzeni bozmadan iz bırakmak.

Özetle: theHunter: Call of the Wild bir oyun değil;
sabırla işlenmiş bir doğa meditasyonudur.
Ve bazen bir kurşun atmadan 2 saat geçirirsin…
Ama o 2 saatlik yolculuk, seni şehir stresinden 5 yıl uzaklaştırır.
