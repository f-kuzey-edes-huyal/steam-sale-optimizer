"Relaxing, long drives throughout most of Europe, if you have all the DLCs, and they're definitely worth the extra money. I've been playing this game nonstop since I bought it, and it truly is a gem. Not all roads are exactly the same, some might be under construction, some might have wrecks, some might have cars that were pulled over, etc... The AI isn't perfect either, and I'm not saying that in a bad way. Quite the opposite. The AI vehicles sometimes make mistakes, just like humans. The massive map is also very detailed, foliage looks real, cities look alive, there's fog in the morning, this games truly has some of the most realistic map designs I've ever seen. 

(This section is me complaining to devs, so if you're a gamer, skip this paragraph)

The one and ONLY critique of this game is the fact that they never released The Heart of Russia DLC. I'm a sucker for Eastern European architecture, and we got a little bit of Russia in the Baltics DLC. I'm definitely not saying I support the war, but releasing the DLC wouldn't necessarily support Russia. Maybe a more ideal approach would be, well if the war doesn't end soon, create a Ukraine DLC, release it, then finish the Russian one and release it as well. That would make the studio remain neutral, and plus, the studio would also be getting the best of both worlds. (If you publicly condemn one side, then people from that side would most likely not want to buy your game.) But that's just my idea. 

This game is also super fun when paired with something else. For example, I listen to audio books when I'm on the road. Podcasts or songs would also be very entertaining. This is, overall, the best driving simulator I've ever played. And I'm assuming American Driving Simulator is up there too.",0.15480263157894741,1752982101,True,227300

"Almost a great game.
My impression --> The game is quite fun and interesting probably the better of the triage of Wargaming.net games. However, up to level 5 ships can be researched and bought through the players normal grind. At level 6 and above unless you've purchased a DLC that contains a ship above level 5 the game loses its pull for me. Level 6+ ships require Doubloons that never drop and can only be bought. All the fancy ships require currencies that are impossible to acquire without purchasing in-game items. If you don't mind playing below level 6 with the exception of DLC's you will actually enjoy the battles.  Doubloons are the major in-game currency and the caveat being that unless doubloons start dropping the paywall truly separates further progression in play unless you're willing to fork out some serious cash for the really boss ships they offer by buying the in-game currencies.",0.03486842105263157,1752448003,True,552990

"I gave this a positive because there is not a neutral option. 

The game is beautiful to look at, the combat is great and it is priced between free and $9.99, so at a very base level, it's really a good buy. 

However, to really get a decent functional experience, expect to pay an additional $200 minimum. If you get sucked into competitive progression or have little self-control, the price is pretty much limitless. The game has tons of inconvenience by design with pay for convenience solutions. Also, it is a case study in manipulative micro transactions. If you are hyper vigilant about avoiding unnecessary/manipulative micro transactions (and give up any aspiration of competitive progression) you can get years of great escapist fun out of the game for a reasonable price.

The gameplay and world building are super frustrating because with a bit more care, they could have one of the largest and deepest fantasy realms to lose yourself in. After having tried for years to make sense out of the goddawful gibberish the NPCs babble, it's just not worth it. Trying to read the text quest/understand the ""story"" will cause literal physical pain. You will get a headache after two or three sentences.

TLDR - Play for years and years on around $200 minimum. Story is nonexistent - make your own fun. Enjoy the scenery and the jiggles.

"I created this account to try iRacing one last time, since I had already tried it for 1 month in my main account.
This game is straight up not worth it, you're paying a premium for the illusion of feeling like you're part of an elite cult.

[h1]The positive[/h1]
iRacing sports an incredible amount of variety when it comes to tracks and cars, no game even comes close to it and likely never will.

The cars are beautifully modeled, tons of detail on the interior and exterior of the cars. The setup pages also look believably realistic, with each car sporting very different options for each part you can fine tune.
Not many other games go this far with detail, especially on the setup menus.

There are always people playing this game, I don't think I've ever seen the online player count be below 10k, regardless of the time. Again, no other game in the same genre gets even close, and probably none will ever.
However, this doesn't necessarily mean all races are populated. I'll talk about it in the negative part.

Sadly, that's about it. There are many other positive points but they get so heavily overshadowed by the negative part that they will need to be addressed in the next part. Also, there is one big problem with this game that essentially renders all these good things pointless anyways.

[h1]The negative[/h1]
Even though there's a lot of variety, a lot of series will see a very small attendance number. I think part of this is because many events have a lot of waiting time between races, forcing people who want to race more often to the series that do run more often.
Most players will be doing sports car racing, oval and formula run rather similar numbers at a glance. The dirt racing stuff is kind of a wasteland, I'm pretty sure you'll be seeing the same names for a long time if you decide to race those series.
Some series run tons of events with only 10 players at most, sometimes there may be a spike at a certain hour but that's the one time during the day that series sees multiple splits.
Most people will be doing MX5s or GT3s, but GT3s only run every two hours although enough events cross over for constant racing. I don't know about Oval or Formula, but I'm sure it works the same way but with less people.

Most tracks are still missing properly modeled rumble strips, they just play sound and have slightly less grip but that's about it. They don't bump the car up and down, it's very easy to just drive over the curbs without the car really protesting.  Granted, even on the tracks with proper collisions on the curbs the cars still behave nice, but the difference is noticeable and you have to be more careful to not make a mistake when driving over them.
Trackside objects range from okay to 2008. More recent tracks, or tracks that had been revamped recently, look fine, but there are a lot of tracks that look very dated. At least the driving surface is nice and detailed, but they really look a generation old.

The car collisions and general netcode doesn't feel great either. Sometimes the smallest contact gives you tons of damage, sometimes a pretty hard hit does nothing.
Their lag compensation stuff is pretty inconsistent, but sadly people don't play with that in mind...
Most of my races I've just sandbagged quali and just took the scraps during the race. If you're trying to go through the licenses to unlock the races for the content you purchased, be prepared to avoid racing because it's far too dangerous to go close to other cars.

Then of course, the big iRacing tyre debacle.
It is as you've heard, these tyres cannot go over the limit without throwing a fit. You have to under drive the car to be on the limit, the tyres will be screeching and screaming but your inputs are like if you're driving grandma to church.
It's very counterintuitive, but honestly, once you get the hang of it it's pretty nice.
The low speed grip is nice and the cars do feel very darty and planted, a big contrast when compared to many newer sims that have a very sloppy and delayed initial bite to the tyre. But this comes at the cost of the tyres just turning off the moment you press the throttle a bit too hard, or trailbraked a bit too well.
It's very easy to tell when you go over the limit, but once you notice that it's almost always too late. To be fair, it's easy enough to stay under the limit, but of course you have to push the limits of the tyres to go fast and the game punishes you very harshly when you go over.
Even the updated GT3 tyres have this issue, and this was the main reason I wanted to try iRacing. If this is worlds better than what they had before, I honestly feel bad for whoever was driving GT3s before. The car will just wipe out on you when the tyres are on the colder side and even when up to temp it's very easy to just have the car die on you.
The MX5s are absolute hell to drive, these cars are thrashed around the track in real life, but in iRacing you need to drive them with clinical precision. You're still doing 4 wheel slides through the turns, but your inputs really don't match what the car is doing. It's very, very awkward.

[h1]The worst part[/h1]
This would all be acceptable if it wasn't for the insane premium you have to pay.
Steam is the cheapest way to get into this game, I bought 1 year of iRacing for ~20 euro (yes, after tax). I also bought two GT3s because I wanted to have those so I could compare the driving with other games.
However, once this subscription is over I'll have to pay ~80 euros to renew it, and that is on Black Friday which is the cheapest discount they offer for renewals.

But the subscription is just the beginning, then there's a fee of ~14 euros per car and ~17 per track. The final price will depend on your country or state's VAT, but it won't be too far from that.
If you decide to get into a series that doesn't run a lot of free content, you'll be paying around 150 euros to be able to race it. And that will only work for that season which changes every quarter. They'll keep making you buy new tracks if you want to do all the races in your series of choice.
There's a discount if you buy stuff on bulk, but it's such a small amount that won't really make a dent unless you're spending thousands on getting all the content in the game.
THOUSANDS to have everything in this game, not hundreds.
This is how they lock you into their game. You spend thousands on the content, so what's another $200 every 2 years to keep using it.

Maybe it's my luck, but this doesn't help with the quality of the racing anyways. You'd think that people who get into this game and pay hundreds every year for the content and the game would take it more seriously and avoid dumb moves, especially with how this game's netcode can be pretty bad. 
Top split, bottom split, doesn't matter, a lot of people just don't know how to drive and they just ruin everything. Again, this would be fine if it wasn't for the cost.
On the topic of the netcode, a lot of people say the price of the subscription is justified since they need to keep the service running, but other games are doing a better job while being a fraction of the price.

"I played the demo back in 2023 & subsequently the full game on release day on my trusty PS4. I picked it up on my PC after the release of Overture DLC to go through it again. It really is a special game. Amazing story & characters, weapon animations that rival & sometimes even surpass those seen in FromSoftware's portfolio.


[h2] ""Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness"". [/h2]

While the game clearly borrows heavily from FromSoftware’s formula, it truly comes into its own when introducing original ideas. The Legion Arms—especially after the DLC—are a joy to experiment with. Other standout mechanics include the vinyl record collectibles and the record player in the hub, as well as the P‑Organ upgrade system, which adds depth to character progression.

However, the level design is where the game falters. Environments often feel bland and uninspired, turning exploration into a monotonous trek from one boss to the next with only occasional side paths. During my first playthrough, I overlooked this, still holding out hope for variety. But on repeat runs, the lack of engaging design becomes painfully apparent.

Side quests suffer from similar shortcomings. Rather than encouraging organic discovery, the game relies on star-gazer icons or Gemini’s voice lines to nudge players toward objectives. This handholding undermines immersion and feels disengaging—similar to how Atreus or Mimir in the newer God of War games frequently spell out puzzle solutions, robbing players of the chance to think for themselves.

Another thing that stood out during my second playthrough is how much easier the bosses felt. Enemies that once seemed nearly impossible at launch now fall quickly, even on Legendary Stalker difficulty. Maybe I’ve improved, but it’s been two years since I last played—and that was only a single run.

Continuing on that thread, the new audio log feature introduced in the DLC is another misstep. It takes control away from the player, forcing you to sit through two-minute recordings without the option to interact or skip.

And finally, I’ll admit that one issue may be partly on me: running the game on a Linux machine causes it to crash about every 20 minutes. The only reliable fix I’ve found is launching it with the -dx11 argument to force DirectX 11.


 [h2] With all that said.. [/h2] 

I love this game, I love this game with all its flaws. I love the characters, I love the plot, I love the small bite-sized stories in the side quests, I love the beautiful vinyl soundtracks, I love the combat, I love the weapons, I love the bosses. It is refreshing to see someone other than FromSoftware take a swing at this formula.

(Это не столько обзор, сколько субъективное мнение игрока, который провел много времени в Soulslike.)

[h3]Пройдено за ~15 часов. В целом, немного разочарован – ожидал большего, чем слабую копию того, за что любят Dark Souls, Elden Ring и Sekiro.[/h3]

[h3]Что не понравилось:[/h3]

- [b]Лута слишком много, при этом 90% – мусор.[/b] Ценные вещи попадаются раз в главу, и к середине игры пропадает желание обыскивать углы.
- [b]Прогрессия по опыту слишком быстрая[/b] – обычные мобы почти не опасны (за редкими исключениями).
- [b]Некоторые атаки [u]некоторых[/u] боссов плохо читаются[/b], приходится полагаться на забегания за спину и кувырки (но это уже «Git Gud»).
- [b]Локация с шарами[/b] – откровенная копия Крепости Сена из DS1.
- [b]Механика прыжков[/b] – такая же убогая, как в DS.
- [b]Статус-эффекты[/b] – слизаны один в один (даже «Поломка» – аналог «Смерти» от василисков).
- [b]Протез как из Sekiro, но реализован скучно[/b] – почти не пользовался.
- [b]Музыка никакая[/b] – ни один трек в битвах с боссами не запомнился.
- [b]Шорткаты банальные[/b] – мир неинтересно исследовать, ведут за ручку.
- [b]Обычные атаки стаггерят врагов[/b] – большинство мобов просто не могут ничего сделать.
- [b]Оружия много, но интересного почти нет[/b] – прошел на рапире, остальное показалось скучнее и неудобнее.
- [b]Амулет подзарядки ХП ломает баланс[/b] – с ним и так простые пробежки к боссам становятся еще проще.
- [b]Амулеты и Куб[/b] – почти полные аналоги из Elden Ring.
- [b]Персонажи скучные, диалоги шаблонные[/b] – никто не запоминается.
- [b]Последняя глава ужасна[/b] – куча жирных мобов, пустые локации, ощущение DS2.

[h3]Что понравилось:[/h3]

- [b]Несколько классных боссов:[/b] Падший архиепископ Андреас, Король Марионеток, Лаксазия, Безымянная марионетка.
- [b]Визуальный стиль[/b] – художники молодцы, мир выглядит потрясающе (кроме финальной главы).
- [b]Оптимизация[/b] – идеальная работа даже на ультра-настройках (RTX 4060 + Ryzen 7).

[h3]Удобные QoL-фичи:[/h3]

- На точках телепорта указано, где есть квестовые NPC.
- Рипост с маркерами – удобно, даже если немного казуально.
- Механики восстановления фласок и сброса талантов – приятные и полезные.

[h3]Вывод:[/h3]

[h3]Советую, но с оговорками.[/h3]

- Если воспринимать игру как отдельный проект, а не кальку FromSoftware – получится неплохой Soulslike.
- Если вы фанат DS/ER/Sekiro – брать только на скидке, иначе будете разочарованы.
- Overture куплю когда-нибудь на распродаже по большой скидке и пробегу с другим билдом.

"Steam rolled out a sneaky unpacking scheme change on July 10th. This change affected many games recent updates, including RimWorld Odyssey, which released the 1.6 variant soon after. Ultimately, this made Odyssey and users attempting to update to 1.6 impossible if they are running Steam on an older operating system that is no longer supported (Windows 7, 8, 10).

The only solution I can find is that you must select the beta 1.5 patch of RimWorld prior to a clean install, and disable this expansion in order to successfully install. Otherwise, the download will hang in corrupt file/content unavailable forever.

Unfortunately, at this time, there is no work around for players using older operating systems.

"Je suis atrocement déçu par leur décision de mettre en vente des points d’apprentissage. J’ai joué pendant très longtemps des MMOs, peu m’ont tenu en haleine dans leur capacité à faire un monde persistent ou peut coexister le PVE et le PVP… Albion faisait partie de la liste, jusqu’à hier.

Je veux comprendre qu’ils aient peut-être des problèmes d’argent, mais dans un jeu ou TOUT est fait par les joueurs, mettre en ventre les points d’apprentissage n’est pas juste accélérer un processus. Mêler cela au système de Premium (qui allait je trouve) mènera à du PVP ou le portefeuille va être l’arme forte, ce qui mènera ceux qui veulent avoir une suprématie (après tout, on pouvait déjà acheter de l’or, qui permettait d’acheter de l’argent), à accepter dans leurs guildes d’autres qui vont aller utiliser le portefeuille par commodité parce qu’ils veulent gagner, ce qui n’est pas un mal mais qui n’aura rien de méritant et c’est tout le jeu qui va mourir.

어린 애비로 시점이 바뀌었을 때 처음 의문이 들었고
게임의 절반을 애비로 플레이하며 불신은 커져만 갔고
애비를 조작하여 엘리를 박살낼 때 완전히 무너졌다
엔딩에 도달하고 남는 것은 허탈함 뿐이었다

이후로도 오랜 시간 동안 이 스토리를 곱씹으며
이 게임에 대한 내 복합적인 감정을 정리해보려했다
사랑할 수 있는 게임은 절대 아니다
그렇지만 싫어할 수도 없었다
그만큼 나에게 [b]라스트 오브 어스[/b]는 놓아주기 힘든 게임이었다

[b] - 많은 팬들이 등을 돌리게 만든 불쾌한 스토리[/b]
돌이켜 보면 조엘의 죽음 자체는 속편에서 필연적이었다
조엘과 엘리의 관계는 1편에서 서사적인 역할을 끝마쳤고
조엘이란 인물도 변화의 여지가 없는 안정 상태에 도달했기 때문
하지만 여론이 증명하듯 그 연출과 방식이 너무나 불쾌하여
플레이어들의 반감과 필요 이상의 분노를 살 수 밖에 없었다

복수에 눈이 먼 엘리가 망가져가는 과정에 깊이 몰입할 수 있게
조엘의 죽음에 엘리가 느꼈을 극심한 분노와 트라우마를
노골적으로 강조시켜 보여주는 연출 방식을 선택했다는데
[b]플레이어의 감정선[/b]을 고려한 서사나 연출의 수위 조절없이
이런 불쾌함을 그대로 느끼게 하려 했다는 의도 자체가 무리수

게이머는 게임을 통해 현실 밖의 신선한 경험을 느끼길 원한다
때로는 불편하고 기이한 감정도 신선한 경험이 될 수 있다
하지만 이러한 게임들도 플레이어가 게임을 중단할 정도로
아무런 보상도 없이 불쾌함만을 극한으로 밀어붙이진 않는다
생각할 거리와 찝찝한 여운은 두 시간짜리 영화로도 충분하다
사랑했던 캐릭터들의 붕괴와 관심도 없는 애비의 서사를
20 시간 동안 지켜보게 만들며 [b]고문[/b]을 시킬 필요는 없었다

물론 이 모든 고통 속에도 감동의 순간이 있긴 했다
대표적으로 엘리의 16살 생일 파트를 비롯한
조엘과 엘리의 과거 회상 장면들
안타깝긴 하나 본편의 이야기가 이 장면들에
의미와 감동을 더해주는 역할도 무시할 순 없다
허무한 엔딩을 보고도 가슴 한편이 저려온다는건
이 게임이 적어도 이러한 감정은 잘 공략했다는 것

하지만 그건 어디까지나 [b]전작의 스토리[/b]에 기반한 연출일 뿐
뛰어난 게임 플레이가 아니었다면 길어진 플레이 타임에 비해
[b]본작의 성취[/b]는 한참 부족하게 느껴졌을 것
특히나 애비 파트는 사실상 실패라는 생각이 든다

[b] - 이 게임의 가장 큰 결함, 애비[/b]
닐 드럭만 본인이 말했듯이 플레이어가 [b]애비를 이해하지 못 하면[/b]
이 게임 자체가 [b]실패[/b]일 수 밖에 없는 구성이었다
초반엔 조엘을 잔혹하게 죽이게 되는 빌런 포지션이면서도
게임 분량의 절반을 차지하는 새 주인공이기도 하기 때문
실제로 많은 게이머들이 게임이 끝날 때까지 애비를 증오하였고
그것이 이 게임의 가장 큰 실패 중 하나였지만
정말 모르는 건지 이 악 물고 부정하는 건지
개발진들은 전혀 그렇게 생각하지 않는 것 같다
 
플레이어가 애비를 이해하고 공감할 수 있을 거라 생각했다는게
제작진들이 단체로 약이라도 빨았던건지 이해가 안되는 부분
기본적으로 플레이어가 적대하다 못해 혐오할만한 캐릭터였다
외형적으로도 남자보다도 크고 과장된 근육질의 몸에
발달된 이마 광대 턱등 얼굴도 확신의 빌런상으로 만들어놓고도
애비가 주인공으로 받아들여질 수 있을거라 생각했나

애비의 동기는 충분히 이해가 되지만 전작을 사랑한 팬 입장에서
어쨌든 조엘을 죽인 캐릭터인데 어떻게 용서를 할 수 있을까
전작도 이런 이기적인 [b]개인의 감정[/b]을 바탕으로 한 이야기였다
게이머들이 조엘의 마지막 선택에 자연스레 공감했던건
그런 사랑의 감정 앞에선 이기적인 행동도 서슴치 않으리란 걸
[b]조엘의 입장[/b]에서 완전히 몰입하고 공감하였기 때문이다
그런데 이제 와서 애비의 관점을 이해하고 공감해주라고?

애비를 주인공으로 내세울 거면 스토리 구조를 바꿨어야 했다
시작부터 조엘을 죽인 왠 고릴라년 하나만 노리고 쭉 달려왔는데
마침내 얼굴을 마주보고 대립하게 된 상황에서
과거 애비 시점으로 돌아가 [b]이제서야[/b] 서사를 풀겠다는게 참
정체를 숨기고 복수극에 집중할거면 끝까지 [b]빌런[/b]으로 남기던가
아님 애비의 스토리를 먼저 풀어서 [b]적대감[/b]을 완화시키던가
엘리와 하나 되어 복수의 길을 걸으며 증오를 쭉 쌓아오다가
갑자기 증오와 복수의 대상이었던 캐릭터에 공감해달라고?

특히 조엘&엘리와 애비의 [b]대응점[/b]을 계속해서 강조하려는 연출
[b]기린[/b]-[b]얼룩말[/b], [b]수영[/b]-[b]추적 실습[/b], [b]박물관[/b]-[b]수족관[/b], 레브, 임신 등
억지로 플레이어들이 애비에게 공감을 하도록 유도하는
개발진의 같잖은 수작질들이 너무나 가증스러웠다

애비의 인간적인 모습을 보여주고 공감대를 형성하려 넣은게
더럽고 추잡한 오언과의 불륜씬이었다는 것이 참 충격적이다
코멘터리에서 구구절절 설명하는 내용을 들으면서
원래 연출 의도가 무엇이었는 지는 알 수 있었지만 
이 혐오스러운 캐릭터에 몰입하고 이해하려 노력할 
인내심이 바닥난 나에게는 그닥 와닿지 않았다
엘리 보스전에서는 대놓고 불편한 느낌을 의도했다고 하는데
아무 의미도 보상도 없는 불쾌한 이야기에 누가 매력을 느낄까

[b] - 한 쪽은 포기했어야 했다[/b]
엘리와 애비의 입장 둘 다 [b]이해할 수는 있다[/b]
하지만 양쪽 [b]모두[/b]의 입장에 완전히 [b]몰입하고 공감할 수는 없다[/b]
당장 나의 부모님을 죽인 살인범을 용서해줄 수 없듯이
양쪽 모두의 입장에 공감할 수 있다는 건 
양쪽 모두에게 감정적으로 [b]깊게 몰입하지 않았다는 것[/b]

엘리 파트에선 [b]엘리[/b]가 되어 [b]끔직한 상실감과 들끓는 복수심을[/b]
애비 파트에선 [b]애비[/b]가 되어 그 [b]트라우마와 고뇌, 갈등을[/b]
[b]양쪽 모두를 공감시킬 순 없다[/b]
명백한 선택과 집중의 실패다

차라리 공감하지도 못할 애비 분량은 과감히 단축하고
앨리의 상실과 자기 파괴적인 복수심에 더 초점을 맞추는 게
그나마 플레이어들에게 더 효과적으로 다가갈 수 있었을 것
이 게임은 철저히 [b]조엘과 엘리[/b]의 이야기로 남았어야 했다
조엘을 죽인 캐릭터를 세번째 주인공으로 쳐 넣었다는게 참

[b] - 그럼에도 부정할 수 없는 완벽한 게임 플레이[/b]
이 게임이 비디오 게임 역사상 가장 미친 기술적 완성도를 
보여준 다는 점에 반대할 사람은 없을 것이다
전작의 뛰어난 액션 요소를 더욱 보완하며 스케일마저 늘렸고
[b]그래픽[/b]은 물론 [b]애니메이션, 상호작용[/b] 등
충분한 자원과 함께 업계 최고의 인재들을 갈아 넣어야만
나올 수 있는, 다른 대부분의 개발사들은 꿈도 못 꿀 퀄리티다
게임의 이런 장점에 대해 이야기 할 때마다 매번
""스토리 빼면 갓겜"", ""스토리가 망쳤네"" 등의 
한심한 불평이 따라붙는게 안타까울 지경

[b] - 극단적이고 편향된 작가진과 리더십의 예고된 결말[/b]
개발자 코멘터리나 비하인드 영상을 보면서 가장 눈에 띄었던 건
닐 드럭만 만큼이나 극단적인 성향의 공동 작가 핼리 그로스
둘 다 공통적으로 폭력이 인류의 [b]보편적인 감정[/b]이라 주장한다
게이머들의 다양한 배경과 이 게임을 바라보는 태도를 무시하고
자신들만의 극단적인 폭력에 대한 가치관이
자연스레 받아들여질 것이라 기대했던 것이 너무나 큰 오산

핼리 그로스는 특히 코멘터리 영상이나 팟캐스트에서 조차
공격적이고 혐오에 찬 발언이나 욕설들을 서슴치 않게 하는 등
전작처럼 닐 드럭만의 균형을 맞춰줄 수 있는 [b]중재자[/b]가 아니라
[b]비슷한 성향[/b]의 공동 작가와 함께 탄생한 이 게임의 각본은
근본적으로 완성도를 떠나 많은 이들이 공감할 수 있는
[b]보편적인 테마[/b]를 보여주긴 어려운 운명이었을지도

게임 출시 직후의 부정적인 반응에 대한 코멘트도 있었다
이 게임을 싫어하는 사람들을 그저 단순한 헤이터들이라고,
우리가 woke 하고 다양성을 내세우는 것에 대한 반발이라고,
게임을 제대로 이해하지도 못하고 혐오하는 것 뿐이라고.
정작 본인들이 게임의 테마에 지나치게 몰입해서 반대 의견들을
""[b]게임 속 실수를 똑같이 반복하는 NPC들[/b]"" 취급하는 건 아닌지

[b] - 끝내 미워할 수 없는 게임[/b]
전작의 조엘과 엘리를 사랑했던 팬으로서는
너무나 힘겹고 불쾌한 경험이었지만
평론가들의 평이 이해가 안되는 것은 아니다
이 게임이 훌륭한 완성도를 보여주는 것은 분명한 사실
스토리 부분도 전작의 주인공들에 대한 깊은 충성도와
새로운 캐릭터 애비에 대한 혐오감이 없었더라면
뛰어난 연기, 연출력과 함께 깊은 감명을 줄 수 있었을 것이다
실제로 6회차를 진행하며 조엘의 죽음과 애비에 대한 불쾌함이
점점 무뎌지니 더 쉽게 몰입이 되며 여러 새로운 감정이 들었다

어쩌면 개발진들도 이 스토리를 계속 작업해오면서
본인들이 이 불쾌감에 무뎌진 것을 인지 못하고
처음 플레이하는 게이머들도 받아들일 수 있으리라
착각을 한 것이 아닐까 라는 생각도 든다
작가 둘은 절대 인정하지 않겠지만

극단적으로 분열된 여론이 증명하듯 게임 자체는 훌륭하지만
사람에 따라서는 절대 받아들일 수 없는 스토리이기도 하다
양쪽 다 잘못된 것이 아니기에 서로를 욕할 필요는 없다
조엘과 엘리를 향한 개인적인 애착 때문에 생기는 불쾌함을
견디거나 게임과 분리시켜 감상할 수 없는 나같은 사람에겐
당연히 힘들고 거부감이 들 수 밖에 없는 게임이다
다만 그 점이 싫다고 해서 이 게임이 성취한 부분을 
불합리하게 까내리거나 부정하려는 행동은 잘못된 것이고
이 게임을 싫어하는 사람들을 못배운 인간, 더 나아가
죄인 취급까지 하는 것은 더더욱 해서는 안 될 짓이다

"Ready or Not WAS a game that I would've recommended, had it not been for the latest update.
Most of this game is designed to be gritty and disturbing, but not without merit. It's brutal because it's real, and real life is brutal. If SWAT officers are dispatched, it's because there's an issue beat cops couldn't fix. Things like armed gunmen, whether robbery or active shooters in, say, schools or nightclubs, or weapons/drugs/human smuggling, and there is value in showcasing something that most games, shows or movies wouldn't. 

Before Ready or Not's full release, Void left their publisher over the level 'Elephant' which showcases an active shooting within a community college. The publisher said it was too much and Void left them to keep that part of the game. It showed integrity on their part, imagine how many copies could've sold with a publisher bankrolling them. But now that full launch is here and Void can stick the game on PS and Xbox, now they're willing to censor. Now they think some things are too graphic. If that integrity they had when they left their publisher is fully gone, as it seems, then maybe Daddy Sony tells Void that the Nightclub Shooting or School Shooting levels are too intense and controversial. I think Void would rather follow that dollar than show that they still believe in what they started.

The worst part about all of this is they, Void, started this conversation. Everybody already knows that these horrors happen, but Ready or Not gave you the front row seat. Void said 'there might be some extravagance but for the most part, this is real.' And everyone was engaging with that conversation, but now that the conversation isn't as profitable to them as it was a month ago, they'd seemingly rather stop talking altogether. And it's not like it would be impossible to keep the graphic content. It could be something that's exclusive to PC or it could be a feature that needs to be toggled on or off before playing. But either of those ideas need something to make happen: Money. And if the Devs are willing to censor the conversation they started for a boost in sales, why would they spend a dime to keep the majority of their playerbase as of now happy? Why listen to the feedback of people who already bought your game, There's a new market now!

Above everything its just disappointing to see. A developer that WAS willing to push the boundaries of what you could show in a game tasted the sweet milkies from consoles and abandoned their stance.",0.0025482093663911835,1752984094,False,1144200

"It claims ""free"", but you have to invest so much its ridiculous. Minimum $100 for a flight stick, $30-$60 for maps, and anywhere from $10-$100 for the planes & jets themselves. Only time you should consider is if a friend or someone will sell you a flight stick for cheap. Be prepared to join random discord channels because there is no way you'd be able to convince your pre-existing group of friends to dump this much money for a ""once a week"" or ""once a month"" gaming session.

My personal experience: I never got to play this game tbh, but I can tell its more bad then good. I figured during the winter sale that I would cop a dlc and wait for a friend to ship me his old flight stick in order to play, I purchased in February and was promised the flight stick around the same time frame, its mid June. My friend, despite constantly playing DCS and Falcon BMS, never got around to sending that stick. In other words, unless its for a job (learning the controls & internals for military or private sector) don't waste your time and money investing into this game, learning a set of skills that would never apply to the average civilian (unless ur stupid and decide to pull a GTA 5 heist to steal a Jet).",-0.02951388888888888,1750269712,False,223750

"Needs more dedicated support for crossplay and pc server owners. I run British RP on FS25 despite getting told go 2022 and its been absolute blast in FS25. Do not see the big hype and love for FS22. Who knows?

Is FS25 perfect? No neither is FS22.
Giant YOU should seriously give players, modders, and server owners a chance to improve the quality of life within their own creations/worlds 

WHY??? A.) Get better multiplayer options B.) Give Modders actual tools and software to make new mods for FS25. C.) Sever owners like myself to have the actual tools to make things happen. Instead of depending on third party mods.

We are not asking much, just please give us PROPER MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT than sticking a label saying its MULTIPLAYER MODE when really is limited to 3/4 slots for self host like LAN. Even Battlefront puts this to shame.

Server owners get limited to 16 slots when it should be 32 or 64 slots. Many platforms have, yet GIANTS cant implement a higher slot base, but what does bother me is giants claims this is as a multiplayer solution when its as limited to an Apple II.

Sorry but up your multiplayer scene as clearly there is a market for actual multiplayer where farms operate in different things. Also add PROXIMITY VOICE its not 1992. We do not want to hear someone from the other side of the map.

"🎮 Cities: Skylines

✅ 장점

높은 자유도
도시를 마음대로 설계할 수 있어서 창의력을 발휘하기 좋아. 도로, 전기, 물, 쓰레기, 세금까지 전부 직접 관리할 수 있다.

뛰어난 현실성
교통 체증, 공해, 실업률 같은 문제들이 실제 도시처럼 발생해서 현실감이 있다. 그냥 건물만 짓는 게임이 아니다.

모드(Mod)의 중요성
유저들이 만든 모드를 설치하면 건물이나 시스템을 무한히 추가할 수 있으며, 모드가 제일 중요하다.

DLC의 다양성
날씨, 교통, 자연재해, 공공 정책 같은 걸 추가해주는 확장팩이 많아서 질릴 틈이 없다.

❌ 단점

높은 진입장벽
설명이 부족해서 처음 하는 사람은 뭘 해야 할지 모를 수 있다. 그렇기에 초반엔 도시가 망하는 게 순식간이다.

컴퓨터 사양 문제
도시가 커지면 프레임이 떨어지고 로딩도 길어져. 특히 모드 많이 쓰면 더 심하다.

UI/UX의 불편함
정보 찾기가 힘들고, 창이 많아서 관리하기 귀찮을 때가 있다.

🏆 총평
Cities: Skylines는 도시 건설 게임 중에서도 완성도가 정말 높은 게임이며,
전략적으로 도시를 키우는 재미가 있어서 시간 가는 줄 모른다.
다만 초보자라면 유튜브나 공략을 좀 참고하는 게 좋다.

"[h1] The Edging of our Fate, as they say. [/h1] 

After Destiny 2: The Final Shape, most people saw that as the exit they needed after ten years for those who stuck around for that long. 

[h3] The Edge of Fate era, System Changes [/h3]

Edge of Fate, without even buying the expansion brings a massive shift in how you go about your day to day in Destiny 2. There is the portal, bringing an easier method for getting into activities that not only [i]give[/i] you stuff but [i]give[/i] you stuff that leads to [i]faster progression[/i]. EoF also brought on the first big reset for anyone who has stuck around in that everyone no matter how long you have played got reset back to 10 Power (Basically your level for anyone who hasn't played the game.) and changed the power grind to a system that still involves at soft cap but at certain point you are able to over level even above 300 for that season or expansion, and once the next comes you start at that soft cap again. Everyone kept the same armor but ditched old stats! The stat system has been overhauled to the same six different stats, but each providing bonuses up to 100 points and even more points as you go further beyond. Ideally avoiding the [i] ""First thing first you need max Resilience"" [/i] situation all other stats have been given a role. Health is the new resilience, not really providing the same defense until you over level it. Discipline and Melee stay nearly the same but provide damage bonuses pass 100 stat points. Intellect, now called Super provides that even go-go juice from [b] all sources. [/b] Class is new, but familiar to titans in that your class ability recharges faster and grants you an overshield. Weapons is a new stat that becomes the main focus for PvP enjoyers since Mobility has been depricated.

[h3] The Fate that was Edged [/h3]

[i] This is gonna be very rough and tumble so as to not spoil story and is mostly about the campaign gameplay itself. [/i]

The campaign is surprisingly heavy on the game time it offers, for very specific reasons. This expansion and the destination that came with it; Bungie claimed would be metroidvania like. Part of those ideas are that throughout the campaign you progressively get more abilities and upgrades to them that allow you to progress the world, open unique Keplar chests, and take the fight to the House of Exile and Choral Vex. 

[b] Matterspark [/b]

[i] You can't use a sparrow here! You got dark matter baby! [/i] Matterspark is one of the first abilities you obtain right out of the gate, without much struggle or training montages. Right out of the gate. Matterspark basically turns you in a small orb, allowing you to transverse small vents and the like. You can sort of attack in this form, chaining attacks across enemies for a small amount of damage. You can jump and dash, so when its around going into this form allows for easier transportation in some cases. Upgrading this allows it to do a AoE burst attack, breaking enemy shields amongst other things. You are vulnerable in this form, but can transition out at anytime while you need to find a specific spot to go back into it.

[b] Teleporty Purple Puzzle Gun (I forgot the name) [/b]

Now this is the puzzle part of the Expansion. [i] let me look up the name of this thing... [/i] The Relocator is a gun you pick up and also upgrade at certain points that allows you to teleport to otherwise walled off (usually with Lasers, its often lasers) areas that you cannot access. It has chops for clearing enemies as well, working like a void scorch cannon with a little more flair.

[b] Mattermorph [/b]

Mattermorph build upon the same tactics of the last two abilities mentioned. It allows you to throw a projectile at highlighted objects in the environment to make them a pathway ahead to a spot to dunk a thing or get to the next thing. Mattermorph also replaces your dedicated melee, turning into a spammable shackle grenade basically, giving you woven mail while also suspending and unraveling your enemies. Very worth abusing in some boss fights. 


[h2] Rushing to a conclusion [/h2]

Having played on legendary right out of the gate and finishing it to completion there, I will say most of the abilities they tried including here feel very hamfisted and did more to kill the momentum of what the story was setting up. Several times, there would be a big moment and I would come into the fight all big shouldered and ready, kill a couple groups of enemies, and then I need to shut down this shield. How do you shut down this shield? Matterspark. Few missions later its the same thing, use matterspark and now the Relocator to get there, and during this boss fight you need to do both to pop its shield so you can keep doing more damage. As you get more abilities and upgrades they ALL are used in every fight. Now while I will say, this something I like as it brings some mechanics into what is supposed to be the bigger storybeats in Destiny 2; the word as I raged through playing on legendary was Tedium. There was a lot of Tedious busy work to do damage on a Boss I know I could beat. Surprisingly did not have a lot of deaths in the campaign during Darkness zones, but once you get to that halfway point the busy work allows for more errors to punish you. During a certain mission towards the end (no spoilers) you have a timer, and impending doom if you don't get to each of the three objectives on the way back to the boss. Having to figure out what they wanted me to do when I didn't do to specifically get some directions on where I was supposed to go, hearing the story characters on comms being so dramatically scared over comms, and then dead silence as I used matterspark or whichever ability to figure out how to go to the next thing killed the entire momentum of all the epic moments I [b]know[/b] they were going for. I may have felt them better on Brave (Normal) difficulty but I wanted the new exotics, such a sucker.

[h3] The Closer and Thoughts to my mess of a review [/h3]

The system changes EoF brings are amazing in my opinion and I was more than okay with them. But you don't need to pay money for that. You get all of those changes, free, and on release. The campaign had some banger cutscenes, you get some REALLY good background on old and new characters, and definitely get the idea that this is a start of a new arc. Being such you get a slight cliffhanger as we wait for further progression on the story. But that's what you get the expansion for; a start to the next era of Destiny 2's story. Playing on Legendary, I would say I was ready to be done with the busy work of all the mechanics they added but for some they may be appealing even on Brave difficulty. They brought vaguely Dungeon-Like mechanics with a small hint of Metroidvania. Adjustable World Difficulty post campaign along with that once you finish the campaign is a solid boon too! But I only say they missed the mark because they focus more on what I needed to be doing during the campaign, rather than having me experience it. I will say the story offered at hand and the implications are big. We learn of the omniscient gods [i] the Nine. [/i] They get more screen time here and speaking of screen time, the cutscenes in this expansion are beautifully done. I would say the best cinematics in the entirety of Destiny 2. Worth the struggle I had getting to the end of the tunnel.",0.14747445832369496,1752984257,False,3186490

"Much like the game's central theme of rehabilitation and rebellion, I was held prisoner of this story for the past five to six weeks, from which I finally broke free last night. 

I must be clear about something, I am a SMT veteran who never played a persona game before and I was not exactly thrilled by the social sim aspect of these games, so I walked in expecting absolutely nothing. despite that fact, I came through completely rehabilitated by this game. There's just.. something marvelous and undescribable about how this story presents itself and develops, even though all your characters follow your stereotypical tropes you still fall in love with and want to spend time with them, even in the most trivial and boring moments you actually have fun interacting with them. You actually spend so much time building your relationships with the cast that you want to see them succeed. The same can be said about most of the villains, most are well written and make themselves hated by the player through their exposition.

As an RPG fan I was looking forward to the dungeons and progression systems in this game, however they are rather simple, the combat is pretty much the same ""exploit weakness to get extra turn"" from the SMT series, which can be pretty cheeseable when you understand it. On the other hand, dungeons are few but well constructed, exactly what I expected from Atlus, nothing magnificent but mostly serviceable (aside from the spaceport, *uck that dungeon). There's also mementos, the ""farm"" dungeon where you go to grind levels and do sidequests, this was by far the weakest part of the game since the dungeon itself is procedurally generated, bland and ugly to look at. However it serves its purpose well.

The story starts pretty weird but quickly becomes incredible, when all pieces start coming into place and you can finally see the full picture the DLC campaing kicks in (you have to fulfill a very specific condition to even trigger this campaign, condition that was not exactly well telegraphed in-game), breaking the pace for a bit before wrapping the story up quite masterfully. 

This game goes beyond the recommendation, this is one of those games you have to experience for yourself, HOWEVER.. there's a catch. Persona 5R is rather lenghty, if you are a working adult with little time to play (like mysef) I think it'll be hard for you to enjoy the game properly, since the game is not only long, but demands lenghty play sessions to actually make some progress. Therefore, I can only recommend this game if you have a month or so to spare.


TL;DR: Wonderful game flipped my view on the social sim aspect, classic atlus experience gamewise, lovable characters, great story with some pacing issues towards the end. ACTUALLY CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO WORKING ADULTS WITH LITTLE PLAYTIME.",0.038596491228070184,1753143954,True,1687950

"Before speaking on anything else, I think theres way too much hate for this DLC. It has loads of content and is not significantly different from the base game.

However, if Elden ring is a 10/10 I'd give SOTE an 8.5/10. First of all, some specific areas do feel a bit more empty than others (The Cerulean Coast and Charo's Hidden Grave, as well as the Abyssal Woods). There are also one or two areas in the map that look explore-able upon first glance but aren't accessible, which can throw you off since there aren't any ""empty spots"" on the map in the base game. (the area south of the Discussion Chamber is empty space and its very misleading). 

Second of all, the difficulty. This is a plus or minus depending on the person, and while you technically have infinite preparation for any boss, almost every single boss you fight in this game does a massive amount of health whilst you do very little damage in return. Even if you are levelled appropriately, and have the correct amount of Scadutree Blessings, the DLC is noticeably harder than the base game.

Third of all, the final boss [spoiler]Consort Radahn[/spoiler]. This somewhat ties into my second point about the difficulty. The attack patterns of all the bosses in the DLC feel balanced. This is NOT the same for the final boss. It's extremely hard to hit him, the whole fight is basically a test of will. ""Oops, I got too greedy and died again"" x20

Dodging his attacks is extremely inconsistent in his second phase due to the uneven ground, so even if you dodge him perfectly it is a hit or miss. His [spoiler](Miquella's)[/spoiler] hair is extremely long and blocks your screen so you can't see anything he's doing. He's extremely laggy due to all of his unnecessary projectiles. His attacks are un-intuitive and hard to read. If he hits you then you will get staggered into oblivion, you are EXTREMELY punished for getting hit.

And finally, the worst part, he's just plain unfun. The devs basically just slap you on the ass like a donkey and say ""run left"" because that is his whole strat. If you run right you will die. If you dodge into him you will die. If you dodge away from him you will die. You have to circle left the ENTIRE fight. I can tell the difference between a skill issue and a badly made boss. I beat him after 4-ish hours and I'm good with never fighting him again. Mind you, this is POST nerf and he is still significantly harder to fight than Malenia. [spoiler]I also wish they created an entirely new boss instead of just bringing back Radahn.[/spoiler]

Fourth of all, the cutscene blueballs you. It's a 5 second cutscene and there's nothing particularly special about it. It didn't feel like there was much effort put into the final cutscene at all.

As a summary, it's a great DLC. I think people talk smack about the DLC because it's almost impossible to live up to the base game of Elden Ring. Messmer is one of my favorite bosses. The Shadow Keep is incredibly fun to explore. It's beautiful, and an interesting concept. I'll bitch about the final boss but it's literally one boss in the entirety of the DLC which is full of fun and intuitive bosses to fight. If the final boss turns you off from the DLC, buy it anyways and skip him and you won't be missing out on much. Same goes for the ""empty"" map. There was a couple areas that were slightly boring to explore, but in the end I still had fun.",-0.0448215621826733,1752978970,True,2778580

"03/04 den Fm 2020 ye kadar düzenli olarak oynamıştım. Çok bir şey değişmiyordu. 24'ü aldım, 3d maç motoru hatrı sayılır oranda değişmiş. Paslar, top tutma, tepkiler, vb. önemli ölçüde değişmiş olarak gördüm. Tabi ben en son 20 de kaldığım için bana farklı geliyor da olabilir.
Yukarıdaki durumların dışında; 
- Frikiklerin gole dönüşme oranı çok düşük.
- Oyuncular grup olarak bir duruma tepki gösterdiklerinde arayı düzeltmek baya zorlaşmış hatta söz vermeden halledemedim.
- 17 yaşındaki wonderkid regen aylık maaşı çok fazla istiyor. reel hayattada böyle mi bilmiyorum ama önceden oyunda o kadar maaş istemezlerdi.
- Gözlemcilik merkezi Fm20 ye göre çok karışık olmuş ya da ben üstünkörü baktım belki de. Normalde üstünkörü baktığımda hep anlaşılırdı idare şekli. Şimdi komple ekibe bıraktım. Herhalde yaşlanıyorum :)

"Pese a los años y las criticas quise darle la oportunidad, y me encontré con un juego tacaño y vació.
Una deluxe edition que ni siquiera te permite jugar al modo singleplayer, te obliga a recolectar monedas en el modo online, lo cual no seria un problema de no ser que el juego esta absolutamente muerto, el juego tarda 10 minutos en emparejarte con bots para jugar una partida de no mas de 3 o 4 minutos, sinceramente es lamentable que este juego siga disponible para su compra.",0.6,1752525073,False,921590

"・DISSIDIA FINAL FANTASY NT Deluxe Edition
セールで-70％オフの￥2,750 となっていたので購入。
無料版ですでに多少触ったことはあり、うっきうきで起動したのですが
Deluxe Editionと銘打ってはいるもののDLCすべては含まれていませんでした。悲しいですね。

Deluxe版だけだと下記が含まれていない状態です。
・キャラ　Ⅶ　ティファ
・キャラ　XII　ガブラス
・キャラ　XIV　ゼノス
・キャラ　XV　アーデン
・スキン　おそらく全キャラクターのスペシャル衣装
（天野さんデザインのWoLやKH版クラウド/スコール等）
・＋スペシャル衣装に沿った武器スキン

また、これらはおそらくずっとセール対象外です。
セール無しで全て購入しようとすると、￥37,000近くかかります。
どうしてもSteam版ですべて揃った状態で遊びたい、となると合計4万程かかります。すっげぇぜ。

なお、オンラインはほんとに過疎です。他の方がレビューしているように、
マッチ時間3分ほどで、自分以外はCPUという状態で対戦が始まります。ほぼ確で。

・ディシディアのストーリーを体験しておきたい
・友達と懐かしみながらフルパで遊びたい
・Steamで販売しているFFシリーズをコンプしたい
っていう人向けですね。
ランク回してディシディアで天下を取るぜって人は、おとなしくPlayStation版を遊びましょう。",0.39999999999999997,1752248602,False,921590
"其实游戏还是挺不错的，看了下评价里多半抱怨的问题，自己还没遇到过
我配置如下
ryzen 1700
980ti
16G
没有调过画质，不敢说丝般顺滑，大概也有个5,60帧的样子

游戏对键鼠有优化，不过目前还不支持鼠标侧键，建议把V键改到Alt，除了鼠标中建，Ctrl也可以防御
至于说没人的情况个人感觉还好，可能是我挂着录播视频边看边玩的原因
5月5日晚上，从8点半打到晚上9点40多，一共打了10把，就有一把联网比赛给我配了5个机器人，其他都是最少1个玩家
没有1v1父子局确实有点难受，我和碰到的独狼玩家都比较有默契，远离AI，躲一边互锤

至于格斗系统，怎么说呢，除开反应能力以外，操作空间不大，因为游戏只有两个攻击键，一个打点，一个打血
可以深挖的地方也许就是算算攻击距离，攻击时长，卡卡时点这种了
粉丝向作品大乱斗，如何要求更多呢，何况本体免费了
趁着打折，749卢布买了个大包

仔细想想我他妈一部最终幻想都没通过（包括零式、核心危机、世界等衍生作品）
FF网游我也没玩过
我为什么要花钱买这个
可能是因为对psp上的异说012有好感吧

"[b]'후즈 앳더 도어'[/b]는 한눈에 보이는 관찰각도, 짧은 동선, 스토리와 연계되는 단서가 되는 환각과 같이 효율적인 덜어내기를 통해 짧은 플레이 타임에도 연출적인 부분을 채워넣는 여유를 보이며 시뮬레이션 시도만으로 종결되는 수많은 '8번 출구 박물관'식 게임들 사이에서 자신만의 스타일을 정립하는 부류의 게임이었습니다. 미스터리한 흐름으로 흘러가다 자연스럽게 마무리되며 다음으로 이어지는 회차 플레이에는 명확한 명분이 있었고, 큰 방해요소 없이 클라이맥스를 향해가는 구성도 좋았습니다.

공포의 형태는 뻔하지만은 않고 블러 처리 옵션(!)이 달릴 정도로 꽤 자극적인 부분도 있었습니다. 물론 그렇다고 굉장한 트라우마를 주는 수준의 공포까지는 아니고, 적당한 텐션, 적당한 징그러움, 매우 유효한 점프스케어들 몇몇이 만족감을 주는 편입니다.

환각 구분 판정에 있어서 한두군데 애매한 구간이 존재하기도 했습니다. 여기에 시간차로 판정이 바뀌는 경우도 존재했기 때문에 대체로 끝까지 확인을 하고 판단해야 했지만 플레이타임이 크게 늘어나는 부분은 아니었고, 구분 실패시에도 이상현상 카운트는 적용됐기 때문에 넘어갈 수 있습니다. 일부 지리하고 자잘한 틀린그림 찾기도 존재합니다만 적은 영역을 차지하고, 스트레스를 받거나 크게 신경쓰이지도 않습니다.

굳이 뭔가 더 궁금하거나 곱씹어보는 저같은 사람들을 제외하면 플레이 타임은 대체로 1.5~2.5시간 정도로 예상됩니다.

"The best story-driven expansion in game development since ""Blood and Wine"", alongside ""Hearts of Stone"".
The location design, environments, and gameplay mechanics — every aspect of the game is excellent.
But the narrative, characters, choices, and music — that’s a separate art form.
This is the peak of what I’ve seen in the gaming industry. I’ve never encountered a more compelling story and storytelling in any game.

CD Projekt Red are masters of visual and interactive storytelling.

the combat is whatever in here, you can just play ""walk in the park"" for the story and survival because the fighting in here it's not really good, you can 1 tap everyone with a bow and 1 single arrow to the head, the game is not really difficult after learning the basics.

after doing both endings and still finishing the Spirit story, i would recommend this if you enjoy survival, some quests are really repetitive, i mean REALLY REPETITIVE, to build something is a grind sometimes but still a fun game for the story.

"I really liked the idea of the game, from the videos

I started playing, first tutorial mode, I screwed up the city layout, I wasn't far in, so I restarted the game
Got to building and planning out the village to prepare for a town, only to realize I cannot upgrade the houses and even though I have 3 Grannerys for food storage and 5 Farms, 3 Fisherys, 2 Bakerys etc...I have not yet got to common people because the house upgrades are expensive. 

Yet despite my 500+ Surplus of food, my villagers are starving and thus making themselves unhappy.
Why?

Every 1/4 Villager is a Useless Head of Household, these guys should be keeping the food stocked, I have food all over my Small Town, yet half my village is starving. Despite having all of the vegetables, fish, bread (Haven't unlocked meat yet)

I really do like the fable/fairy tale portion of it from what little i've seen. Found a glass slipper and a talking tree, declined the beanstalk because we needed food and tried to court Sir Payne.

The other problem is my villagers are just too slow, even if I set priority on a building they will get around to it at least 3 days later sometimes, instead of dropping everything and all grabbing or bringing the resources to that spot, they'll continue with their own job and then come around to it later, which tends to fail quests, even if I have all the resources to make the building.

I really like the idea behind it, just needs a bit of refining",-0.12952898550724634,1753205653,False,1651560

"Fabledom is a city-building simulation game that takes a refreshing and whimsical approach to a well-worn genre. Developed by Grenaa Games, it trades the gritty realism and micromanagement-heavy focus of many modern city builders for a lighter, more fairy tale-inspired tone. With its charming visuals, accessible mechanics, and romantic storytelling elements, Fabledom offers a cozy, engaging experience that invites players to create and govern a fantastical kingdom full of adorable citizens, mythical creatures, and diplomatic intrigue. It’s a game that values personality and playfulness as much as it does strategic depth.

The basic premise of Fabledom is familiar: start with a small plot of land, gather resources, build structures, and grow your settlement into a flourishing kingdom. However, the execution is where the game distinguishes itself. Everything from the UI to the art design exudes warmth and charm, featuring a storybook aesthetic with lush green fields, cartoonish buildings, and animated villagers that feel alive and expressive. The atmosphere is relaxing without being dull, with enough layers of challenge and variety to keep even experienced players invested. Instead of industrial growth or military conquest, the focus is on well-being, aesthetics, and the relationships between your citizens and neighbors.

A standout feature is the way Fabledom introduces narrative and character into city building. You aren’t just developing infrastructure—you’re crafting a living story. One of the more unique aspects is the inclusion of royal suitors from neighboring kingdoms, each with distinct personalities and diplomatic consequences. Courting one of them becomes a narrative thread that weaves into your overall strategy, impacting trade, alliances, and even the aesthetics of your city depending on the traits of the ruler you pursue. This romantic and political system adds a layer of personal investment to what might otherwise be a mechanical process of expansion.

In terms of mechanics, Fabledom strikes a balance between accessibility and depth. Resource management is streamlined without being overly simplistic. Players must still balance food, housing, happiness, and labor, but the pace is forgiving and rarely punishing. Construction and planning feel intuitive, and the game introduces new mechanics gradually, allowing players to learn organically as their kingdom grows. Whether it's introducing farms, bakeries, marketplaces, or defense structures, progression feels steady and rewarding. There's also a degree of customization that allows players to shape their cities according to personal preference, adding creative flair to efficiency.

The game also features light combat and defense systems, but they’re secondary to the main city-building focus. Goblin invasions and wild beasts may threaten your citizens, but the tone remains playful rather than dire. Military structures and hero units can be built to protect your town, and these moments of tension serve to break up the peaceful flow without drastically shifting the game’s tone. This makes Fabledom ideal for players who want just a touch of action without the stress of full-scale warfare or tactical micromanagement.

Visually and aurally, Fabledom is a delight. The colorful, painterly aesthetic is inviting, and animations are smooth and expressive, giving life to every structure and citizen. The soundtrack supports the fairy tale setting with gentle melodies and ambient sounds that create a soothing, immersive environment. From birds chirping in the morning to the bustle of villagers in town squares, the audio design helps make your kingdom feel like a living, breathing world.

If there's a drawback to Fabledom, it’s that players seeking high complexity or realism might find it too lighthearted or straightforward. There’s less emphasis on granular economic simulation or large-scale challenges, and long-term replayability could hinge on post-launch content or expansions. Some systems, such as diplomacy or logistics, feel underdeveloped compared to more traditional city builders. However, the game is still evolving through updates, and the developer has shown a strong commitment to community feedback and continual improvement.

Overall, Fabledom is a beautifully crafted and heartwarming city builder that succeeds by doing something different. It prioritizes charm, storytelling, and accessibility without sacrificing the core satisfaction of growing and managing a vibrant town. For players who enjoy cozy games with a strong sense of personality and a light touch of strategy, Fabledom offers a delightful escape into a magical world where kindness, creativity, and connection matter just as much as productivity.

"[h1] Hikaye [/h1]
[b] Dying Light 2’nin hikayesi, ilk oyuna kıyasla daha uzun ve daha çok seçenek sunan bir yapıya sahip. Ana karakter Aiden'ın geçmişini arayışı biraz klasik kaçsa da, ilk oyunun düz ve kısıtlı anlatımına göre daha gelişmiş ve özgürlük sunan bir yapıda. Özellikle gruplar arasındaki çatışma ve oyuncunun seçimlerle hikayeyi şekillendirmesi, hafif bir RPG havası veriyor. Yine de bazı karakterler yüzeysel kalıyor ve kararların etkisi çoğu zaman beklenenden az hissediliyor. Atmosfer anlamında ilk oyunun o kapana kısılmış, ölümle iç içe havası biraz azalmış ama yerine daha büyük ve yaşayan bir şehir gelmiş.[/b]

[h1] Atmosfer [/h1]
[b]İlk oyunda sonlara doğru bile dışarı çıkmaya korkuyordum. Atmosfer çok gergin ve korkutucuydu, gerçekten oyunun içinde hissediyordun kendini. Ama Dying Light 2’de başladıktan kısa süre sonra rahat rahat dolaşmaya başlıyorsun. Gece vakti çatılardan zıplıyorsun, zombiler artık eskisi kadar korkutucu değil. Sesler ve ışıklandırma da eski oyundaki gibi gerilim yaratmıyor. Kısacası, ilk oyundaki o atmosfer bu oyunda eksik kalıyor. Bir de oyun çok hızlı OP olmanı sağlıyor. Yetenek ağacını açıp güçlü silahlar bulunca, zombilerle savaşmak neredeyse çocuk oyuncağı oluyor. Bu da gerilim ve zorluk hissini daha da azaltıyor.[/b]

[h1] Grafikler & Fizikler [/h1]
[b]Grafikler genel anlamda güçlü. İnsan modellemeleri ve karakter detayları baya başarılı, özellikle yüz animasyonları ve dövüş animasyonları iyi çalışılmış. Çevre detayları da fena değil, ama atmosfer olarak bazı yerlerde boş ve yapay hissettirebiliyor. Fizikler konusunda ise parkur sistemi ilk oyuna göre ciddi anlamda akıcı ve tepkisel çalışıyor. Dövüşlerdeki hissiyat da oldukça tatmin edici.[/b]

[h1] Harita [/h1]
[b]Harita oldukça büyük ve detaylı ama tasarım olarak biraz tekrar hissi veriyor. İlk oyundaki mahalle aralarındaki keşif ve atmosfer bu oyunda yerini apartmanlar arasında zıplamaya bırakmış. Çatıdan çatıya koşmak keyifli olsa da, keşif hissi zamanla sıradanlaşıyor. Keşfedilecek alan çok ama çoğu yer, “burayı da yapmam lazım” gibi hissettiriyor. Yani gerçekten merak edip gittiğin değil, haritada bir ikon gördüğün için uğradığın yerler oluyor. Bu da keşfin doğal değil, görev listesi gibi hissettirmesine yol açıyor.[/b]

[h1]Genel Değerlendirme[/h1]
[b]Dying Light 2, ilk oyunun sağlam temelleri üzerine modern dokunuşlar ve genişletilmiş bir dünya sunuyor. Ancak hikaye ve atmosfer anlamında eski tadı tam yakalayamıyor. Yine de akıcı oynanışı, gelişmiş grafik ve fiziklerle birlikte zombi hayatta kalma deneyimini sevenler için keyifli bir alternatif. Sabırlı oyuncular, oyunun sunduğu seçim özgürlüğü ve yan içeriklerle uzun saatler harcayabilirler.[/b]

"[h1]Good Co-op farm game with potential...[/h1]

This game has a lot of potential and is really fun with a friend, [b]but[/b] this game really needs [b]some optimization[/b] and [b]quality of life[/b] stuff. I like that you can build your own farm, house, stables etc and you have the [b]freedom[/b] to roam the open world, go hunting, care for your animals and do a much more other stuff.

But there are some [b]stuff[/b] I really miss in this game and I hope that the devs will take care of it and add some of this into the game over the time.
[list]
    [*]Double beds have a bug where your partner has to log out and can't sleep in them in the prefab houses
    [*]Driving vehicles is really clunky and would need an optimization
    [*]Building fences without a guide that tells you how ofteh you have to rotate  is a real pain, would be cool if that changes
    [*]This game needs way more building structures like: Let us build brick or stone houses, more roof parts, way more decoration you can use, more house structures in general, real glass windows, chairs you can use
    [*]More food variety, maybe sausage with seasonings, steaks, grounded beef etc
    [*]Give us a list that shows how many animals we have, it's really annoying counting all your chickens over the time
    [*]Friends who logged out should respawn at the place they logged out, not on the bus station
    [*]Maybe some terraforming? I would love a pond with ducks etc and the game really needs the option to build gravel paths or something like this
    [*]Decorative trees, bushes, fruit trees etc would be awesome
    [*]Maybe a more lively city with NPCs walking around, the current NPCs who give quests or work in the shops just sitting there and doing nothing. Some other ranchers who you can sell stuff would be awesome and give the world more life.
[/list]

But don't let you [b]distract[/b] from this list, the game still is fun with friends or alone (If you prefer it this way). It has some really nice things and features already and it seems like the devs still work on this game with their [b]roadmap updates[/b], but still this game needs some more love, fixes and quality of life updates.

"прокурор завел дело на кота по кличке ""Mr. Penis"" за то, что тот скинул со стола и разбил любимую кружку хозяйки.

как позже выяснилось, кот был рекордсменом по прыжкам и скорости бега, но имел ожирение, а также был замечен ранее в том, что продырявил джинсы. Позже доктор подтвердил, что этот кот просто ужас, поставив ему диагноз полного распиздяя.

Адвокат же начал приводить аргументы, что наша хозяйка является шизофреничкой, которая прошла сво, получила птср, и теперь у нее дома лежит штурмовая винтовка АК-47. По версии адвоката и свидетеля-полицейского это хозяйка разбила свою же кружку во время припадка, а затем обвинила в этом кота, которого позже повязал и привез в суд тот самый полицейский. Еще в квартире хозяйки был найден кальян, а также ее кровь на разбитой кружке, что также подтверждает версию о том, что это она разбила кружку.

Под конец заседания прокурор привел улику, что у кота были найдены окровавленные сюрикены, что намекало на то, что Мистер Пинус является вовсе необычным котом. Теперь сложилась версия, что кот разбил кружку, но чтобы уж точно его не посадили, он поранил хозяйку сюрикенами и пролил кровь на кружку, чтобы суд обвинил хозяйку в клевете и освободил кота.

"this game (in my opinion) is an absolute MASTERPIECE.

ive been looking for a game that scratches the zombie horde hack-and-slash itch and this game for me anyway does that perfectly. 

first of all the gameplay, which is built from the ground up centering around melee combat (there is guns but the game is primarily a melee focus) and its dynamic hit placement system. where you hit zombies dynamically will have an effect on how much damage you deal or how much of a zombie's stamina will drain. for example hitting a zombie in the leg with enough force will likely (depending on if the weapon used was blunt or bladed) break it or completely rip it off, making the zombie have to crawl. weapons are also dynamic with stats so heavy blunt weapons for example are high in a FORCE stat, meaning if a hit is to drain a zombies stamina to 0% they will get flung on impact. along with that you also have stuns which is where you can do finishers (or deal massive damage) on zombies which is also alot of fun. the melee combat in this game truly makes you feel like a total badass as its very satisfying yet simple while also keeping alot of fun in it.

STORY AND GAMEPLAY SPOILER
[spoiler] you also have FURY MODE, a mode you unlock about 25% through the story. this allows you to unleash your connection to the autophage virus and literally become a zombie for a short period. you build FURY by performing counter attacks, killing zombies, and the list goes on. when its ready your able to press a button and become a vicious cold blooded zombie predator and rip apart anything standing in your way. your only able to use your hands (called FURY FISTS ingame) but you deal ALOT of damage. its an extremely fun and well made mode. [/spoiler]

as for the story which i see alot of people dont like, i personally enjoyed it. i admit the writing could've been better in some places but its still quite good in my opinion.

overall, this game is brilliant for me. fantastic story, gameplay, and graphics. couldn't have picked a better time to get into it.

Exploring and bactracking respawns the areas making it a huge PIA to get anywhere or getting to stashes.
Zombies take about 5 hits to kill, elite skull zombie bosses around 20 and can IK you. It's a big fucking problem when the boss zombies start spawning as runners at level change points and there is no way of identifiing them untill they aggro.
The whole combat system is weak, weapons have no weight to them, the AI doesn't really react to hits and can hit back whenever it's timer resets. It can be cheesed but it's incredibly boring.
UI is a overly edgy-artsy unintuitive mess. Devs even had to make tips for every single step of navigating it which probably cost more time and effort than if they just made it stupid simple and I'm probably gonna forget half of it if i take a break.

"I came across a TikTok creator who’s been reviewing adult-themed games for over 10 years. He mentioned that many of the titles on Steam are either censored, incomplete, or have been taken down entirely.

He shared a method for accessing the full, uncensored versions — but due to platform limitations, I can’t share it directly here.

So I encoded the instructions using a harmless Chinese tool. If you're curious, just follow these steps:

1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Search for the Chinese term: “兽音译者” (copy and paste it).
3. Click on the first result.
4. Paste the message below into the input box to decode it.
5. Use Google Translate if needed — the site is in Chinese, but it’s simple to use.

Edited 7/19/25

This game is more on the neutral side.

Compared to great roguelites like STS and Brotato, this game is just average.

The game is addictive for not the best of reasons. There are a lot of delayed variable rewards, and seeminly lots to explore but it becomes obvious your adventuring is less impactful to your success than you might think.
The item management is strict, and you have to make a build quickly and specifically to win certain fights.
It is why some people love Balatro and some people hate it. So much of your success depends on rolling one-two good items, and the rest is history. Then everything else becomes very meaningless. Even finding rare events or defeating elite bosses happen so late in the run, that if you are already losing, chances are it won't affect your ability to complete a run.
In terms of addictiveness, I find it similar to Heretic's Fork. It is very RNG heavy and that can be fun at first, but the novelty of it falls off, and when it does, it falls off hard. 
With STS, and brotato, there are many lines you can take that leads to many outcomes, all with its own decision branches. Each run you lose, you can figure out what you should have done or you've learned something. There are many variables that can affect your run, all of which you have agency over.

Yes that happens in this game too, you learn to build something to defeat the first boss. You learn some optimal pathing. You learn what risks to take. But then it immediately stops there. and each and every loss after that becomes RNG. and you ask yourself, what you were meant to do in that situation. and when I say immediately, it can happen from anywhere to 2 hours or 20 hours of playing. there is just so little options in terms of event variety, in terms of pathing, in terms of what resources you can manage. So if that $10 is worth it to you, by all means get this game. I certainly had tons of fun with it and I will be playing it a few more hours. But I'm not sure how much longer this game can hold me.

The other glaring issue and perhaps this is PTSD from rogue tower is, you will unlock items, and it will make your runs even harder. This might be an echo chamber of what others have said about this game, but that feels like a very basic game design issue that needs to be addressed. I'm not saying I want meta progression, but from a design point, it just doesn't make sense. and some of the items unlocked are utterly useless.",0.04639778325123151,1752884788,False,2824490

"Detroit: Become Human is a gripping narrative-driven experience that blends storytelling, emotion, and moral complexity in a way few games ever achieve. Set in a near-future Detroit where androids serve humanity, the game challenges you to explore what it truly means to be alive, free, and human.

You follow the intertwined stories of three androids: Connor, Kara, and Markus, each on their own journey through a society teetering on the edge of revolution. The characters are brought to life by outstanding performances and top-tier motion capture, making every decision you make feel weighty and personal.

What truly sets this game apart is its branching narrative. Every choice you make, no matter how small, can alter the course of the story in meaningful ways. The replay value is immense, and the flowchart system lets you see just how wide the web of possibilities is.

Visually, the game is stunning. From the rain-slick streets of Detroit to the sterile halls of CyberLife, every environment is detailed and atmospheric. The soundtrack is also a standout, with each main character having their own unique, emotionally resonant musical themes.

Whether you're a fan of sci-fi, interactive dramas, or just great storytelling, Detroit: Become Human is a must-play. It doesn’t just tell a story, it lets you live it, and the emotional impact will stay with you long after the credits roll.",0.12187194525904203,1752539732,True,1222140

"Thought I'd give my thoughts on each DLC now cuz why not.

Royalty adds some fairly interesting systems, but at the time, I personally feel like it is the most avoidable gameplay of all the DLCs so far. Not to say that Royalty is bad, or doesn't have content, but most of it is 100% avoidable without even trying, minus the mech clusters. But what it basically adds is the following : 

- Psycasting, which essentially gives your pawns some ""magical"" powers. While I do like psycasting, I find it isn't always good. Really depends what psycasts you got for your pawn, some of them are not very useful in my personnal opinion. The other DLCs added more useful features, but it does synergise well with said DLCs however.
- Royal titles, which gives you a Dwarf Fortress-esque nobility system, where the higher the rank, the more annoying the pawn becomes. It is interesting, but can be a pain depending on where you decided to make your base.
- Mechanoid Clusters will now become a threat you have to deal with. Essentially, it is the Mechanoid's version of a siege.

It does however bring a fairly big list of prostetics which can really enhance your pawns, and... Again... Synergises really well with the rest of the game and DLCs.
And also the OST kicks ass.

Still a DLC I'd recommand, but I'd say it isn't the most important one by itself.",0.08653846153846154,1753036863,True,1149640

Je le trouve unique en son genre, les combats au tour par tour sont intéressants, l'ambiance générale (musique, graphisme et décors nous plongent dans un univers bien ficelé. Les décors et graphismes sont superbes (à mon sens). 
Les bugs sont peu nombreux et n'altèrent pas l'expérience de jeu. 
J'ai passé des heures sur ce jeu et c'est de loin l'un de mes préférés.

Alors pourquoi je le déconseille ? 

Wartale est un jeu sorti le 1er décembre 2021 et qui n'est toujours pas terminé depuis cette date. 
Par contre, de nombreux DLC (excellents pour certains et très mauvais pour d'autres) sont sorti depuis. Si vous souhaitez acheter la totalité du jeu, il vous en coûtera 107 euros (ce qui est beaucoup trop pour le jeu). 

La stratégie commerciale est la suivante : 

A sa sortie, vous achetez le jeu, vous le trouvez génial ( ce qui normal puisqu'il l'est ! ), puis SHIRO Game va sortir un paquet de DLC (de 12 à 19 euros actuellement) qui n'ont pour certains aucun intérêt dans le jeu. L'absence des DLC se fait ressentir pendant l'exploration (endroits inaccessibles), et par frustration de ne pouvoir découvrir ces endroits ,vous allez vouloir acheter les DLC en question... A par Belerion et Skelmar, ne les achetez pas, ils n'en valent pas la peine.  
Les DLC continuent de sortir (le prochain est prévu pour septembre 2025 visiblement, mais je ne l'acheterai pas), et le jeu n'est toujours pas terminé. 
Je me demande même si il sera terminé un jour...

Cette stratégie commerciale a déjà été appliquée sur d'autres jeux de SHIRO Game. Et très franchement, c'est prendre les joueurs pour des pigeons. 


Bref. Le jeu est absolument génial, mais ne l'achetez pas.

"Wartales is an easy game to get going, but I quickly realized there's alot more nuance. I'm 3 months into my first playthrough, so I'm going to see what happens, but on my next playthrough I've already learned quite a few things I'll do differently.

The game has an excellent mechanics, and the combat system allows you to strategize who you engage and when, to attempt to control each battle. Different enemy types force you to adopt different tactics, which is half the fun. I've got 27 hours in so far and it is still engaging and exciting, hopefully it stays that way.

The game doesn't give you too much help on completing quests or lead you by the hand, but sometimes it took me a few minutes to figure out what I was supposed to do. It's a nice middle ground between totally frustrating and too easy.

"This game is the best example of why the stamina mechanic sucks in video games.

What drains your stamina?
Running
Jumping
Dashing
Climbing
Using an ability
Swinging your weapon
Blocking with your weapon
Taking any kind of damage

You need to be out of combat and in a safe spot so that your stamina bar can refill.
Enemies also have special attacks that not only drain your stamina, but put your character in a stunned\staggered state, which makes it impossible to get out of combat.

The thing that makes this worse, is that enemies do not play by the same rules.
They can block your attacks and you can repeatedly hit them when their guard is up, but it won't matter.
They don't wait for a stamina pool to refill. 
The moment they drop their guard, they start swinging away at you like they're on PCP.
This means hitting their guard didn't effect their stamina they same way it effects you.

You allegedly have abilities that are designed to drain stamina and it looks like those abilities work, but it's a little weird.
Those attacks seem to just trigger a stunned/staggered state on an enemy and after that, a whirling dervish of sand and steel rips your face off.

Again, this is an indication that the enemies might not actually have a stamina pool, because I would have to run my ass out of combat in order for the bar to fill back up. 

They just ""magically"" emerge from the stunned/stagger state and begin to rip and tear.

You can separate things from the stamina mechanic.
LOTS of games have done that.
GW2 did it with the dodge mechanic and that game is ancient now, so the devs don't have a fucking excuse for how much this combat sucks.

Honestly, if I buy one more game with a stamina mechanic I'm returning the fucker.
