"My old account has around 3000 hours in CSGO/CS2. I am a seasoned player, but I play exclusively premier matchmaking with my friends around 16,000 rating. I was not prepared for what was waiting for me when switching to my new account.

3 games of death match to unlock competitive game play. No biggie. Took 30 minutes. Then, I realised I need rank 10 to play premier matchmaking. 60 hours later it's done. It has been the worst experience in my entire time playing CSGO/CS2 - ever. Around 40 games with people going AFK, leaving the first round, trolling, being more useless than easy CSGO bots (!!!) and killing team mates for no reason. Mind you, I won MOST of my games since I am in fact playing against retards. But no matter if I lost or won, it was NEVER fun. It's just a chore that had to be done to be able to play against real players with my friends. 

If you're changing accounts, like me - sure: it can be done. But don't expect much. Relax with a few bottles of wine each session and put on a movie in the background. Otherwise, it would simply not be tolerable. If you are a new player, I seriously urge you to consider what you have to do to play the ""real"" CS2. CS2 is free, but you need to pay for Premier match making. 13€ seems cheap, but I would rather drag my dick through glass and eat the shards than do this again.

Why not improve the Anti Cheat instead of putting Premier behind such a wall?  We will never know.",0.004524936868686872,1752880516,False,730

"Almost a great game.
My impression --> The game is quite fun and interesting probably the better of the triage of Wargaming.net games. However, up to level 5 ships can be researched and bought through the players normal grind. At level 6 and above unless you've purchased a DLC that contains a ship above level 5 the game loses its pull for me. Level 6+ ships require Doubloons that never drop and can only be bought. All the fancy ships require currencies that are impossible to acquire without purchasing in-game items. If you don't mind playing below level 6 with the exception of DLC's you will actually enjoy the battles.  Doubloons are the major in-game currency and the caveat being that unless doubloons start dropping the paywall truly separates further progression in play unless you're willing to fork out some serious cash for the really boss ships they offer by buying the in-game currencies.",0.03486842105263157,1752448003,True,552990

"O jogo em si é bem legal, porem é repleto de problemas ainda:
-Para um jogo que parece que quer ir para o meio competitivo ele é possui problemas GRAVES na netcode, a bola e/ou jogadores constantemente ficam ""teleportando"" pelo campo, desaparecendo e reaparecendo em outros locais, constantemente jogadores são desconectados da partida por zero motivos, ou você fica preso em lugar.
-O jogo também tem um serio problema com comunicação, simplesmente não tem como você se comunicar com seu time exceto com o comando de ""Passa a bola"", seria bom um sistema de ping ou um chat rápido ou ""roda"" de comando de voz, como por exemplo ""Vai para X"", ""Deixa eu ser goleiro"" e afins.
-As animações desse jogo estão com problemas também, os jogadores fazendo ""A pose"", ""flutuando"" por ae e atravessando o campo nas comemorações (Em casos mais graves, que ja ocorreu comigo algumas vezes os jogadores simplesmente atravessam e ""caem"" do mapa) ou em casos extremamente chatos, especialmente para goleiros é o goleiro realizando a animação de defesa dando a impressão que você vai defender, somente para a bola passar do seu lado e ir para o gol.
-O jogo não salva algumas configurações, como por exemplo de salvar a dublagem para português que por algum motivo o jogo insiste que tu use a dublagem inglês (Que não é muito boa por sinal).
-E algo que me incomoda pessoalmente é o fato que o jogo mal lançou, em um estado não tão boa e já tem 3 (!!!) microtransações FORA os battlepass, o foco dos Devs parece estar em fazer mais itens para microtransação do que de fato em reparar os problemas do jogo. As atualizações que fizeram nos últimos dias sinceramente foram pouca coisa.

"There is such a lazy and careless effort behind multiplayer skirmish in this game that it's honestly an insult to the legacy of the franchise. If you're thinking about buying this to enjoy the campaign with a friend, I hate to disappoint you but this is not the right place.

This “Definitive Edition” feels more like a quick cash grab than a true reimagining. The co-op experience is shallow, clunky, and clearly an afterthought. The new features barely scratch the surface of what long-time fans were expecting. In fact, there are far better mods out there for the older versions that offer more depth, stability, and love for the original game than this ""upgraded"" release ever does.

It’s cheap, lazy, and full of missed opportunities. The developers might claim it was built with respect for the classic, but it plays like they simply repackaged old content with minimal effort, slapped on a few gimmicks, and hoped nostalgia would do the rest.

Save your money or at least go in knowing that modded versions of the old Stronghold Crusader will probably give you a better time than this.

"Where to begin?

Essential parts of most Sims games are missing behind a paywall, I was one of the unlucky few to actually pay for this game before it went free and it was one kick in the teeth for a lover of The Sims.

Character customisation is very lacking and their is no gradients or hair highlights, only very simplistic within the base vanilla game. The only way to play this game is modded because the vanilla is stupidly expensive as EA decided to milk this cow dry with as many small packs as they could think of. Very disappointing when you consider that other games would have grouped these DLC's into one however the fans still pay so they will carry on making more minor expensive DLC. Buy and download the Sims 2, it might be missing key DLC but it's a more complete experience than this dumpster fire, and to think they keep releasing more dull and easy content because people still pay. For the price, Inzoi is a much better sims esque game and a much more complete experience. It's 2025 and EA is still very much EA.

EA, it's not in the game. They are more ruthless than an Indian tech scammer and almost as shameless.

"The Sims 4 — это популярный симулятор жизни от Maxis/EA, который за годы обновлений превратился в полноценную платформу для виртуального творчества. Игра дарит массу возможностей для самовыражения, но не лишена недостатков.

👍 Что нравится:
✅ Гибкость в создании персонажей – один из лучших в серии редактор внешности (CAS) с детальной настройкой черт лица и тела.
✅ Удобное строительство – режим строительства (Build Mode) стал интуитивнее, с системой перетаскивания комнат и умным размещением объектов.
✅ Много дополнений – за годы вышло десятки DLC (от «Времен года» до «Жизни в университете»), значительно расширяющих геймплей.
✅ Моды и кастомизация – огромная библиотека пользовательского контента (CC) делает игру практически бесконечной.
✅ Оптимизация – работает даже на слабых ПК, в отличие от Sims 3.

👎 Что разочаровывает:
❌ Оскоплённая база – без DLC игра кажется пустой (нет базовых вещей вроде погоды или домашних животных).
❌ Поверхностные эмоции – система настроений (Emotions) упрощена по сравнению с Sims 3.
❌ Откровенно слабые DLC – некоторые дополнения («Путешествие на Батуу») выглядят как наспех сделанный контент.
❌ Однообразный игровой процесс – без модов или собственной фантазии быстро наступает рутина.
❌ Дороговизна – полная коллекция с DLC стоит огромных денег.

💡 Кому подойдёт?
✔ Творческим людям – тем, кто любит строить дома и создавать персонажей.
✔ Казуальным игрокам – для расслабленного геймплея без сложных механик.
✔ Фанатам серии – несмотря на недостатки, это всё ещё увлекательный симулятор жизни.

⚖️ Альтернативы:
The Sims 3 (глубже, но хуже оптимизирована).

Paralives (ещё не вышел, но обещает быть конкурентом).

RimWorld / Stardew Valley (если хочется больше стратегии/фермерства).

🎯 Итог:
The Sims 4 — хорошая, но не идеальная игра. Она отлично подходит для творчества и неспешного отдыха, но без DLC и модов быстро приедается.

"You'll notice, in all the negative reviews, they all have over 300 hours in game. In my opinion, that should immediately invalidate any of them saying ""game incomplete, unsatisfactory, need more content."" Like, what? They played the heck out of the game, on release, for a month straight! Obviously, like any game with amusement park elements, once you unlock everything, maxing out your character, enjoying every hour, you'll run out of things to do. That's not to say you can't find things to do. Toys are there to drive activity. It just takes some friends. For those that play solo, you'll get your 300 some hours and then be waiting for the next content drop. I think that's *well* worth the money. Story's good. Characters are cool. Framework is solid.

"Я нечасто пишу отзывы на игры, в которые играл, да и со вселенной Дюны я был знаком не слишком сильно, но все же решил написать свой отзыв на эту игру. 

Весь обзор можно разделить на две части - то, что происходит до завершения основного сюжета, и что происходит после. 

Сам сюжет поделен на две части - первая часть в основном водит игрока по основным механикам, знакомит с миров и дает понять, где мы вообще оказались. Эта часть игры хорошо - проходить задания, добывать ресурсы, заниматься крафтингом довольно интересно. Строительство здесь сделано дружелюбно, и большую и красивую базу делать действительно интересно. 

Вторая часть сюжета уже проходится гораздо быстрее и интереснее - новыми локациями, поставленными сценами, интересными персонажами и большим количеством референсов на оригинальные книги. И это увлекает! Мне действительно становилось интересно его проходить. Но этот сюжет очень резко обрывается, буквально на самом интересном месте, и заканчивает все это очень быстро. Основного сюжетного контента тут часов на 8. И в итоге придется просто ждать его продолжение.  

И после прохождения сюжета с большим удовлетворением, я задумался - а что дальше-то? И тут мы переходим к самому серьезному минусу. 

Самым серьезным минусом игры является ее продолжительность и итоговый эндгейм контент. 

Для игры, которая хоть и позиционирует себя как симулятор выживания, но имеет ряд MMO-элементов и RPG-составляющей, в игре очень мало контента. За 150 часов я успел закончить весь сюжет, исследовать всю Котловину Хагга, побывать в Глубокой пустыне и поучаствовать в Ландсрааде. Для MMO 150-300 часов - очень маленький показатель. Многие уже рассказывали, что в игре в эндгейме просто нечего делать. Летать по локации, где есть 90% песка и больше ничего, начинает надоедать спустя часов 5-10. А закрывать PvE-данжи, где тебя встречает всего 5 типов основных врагов, которые являются просто губками для урона, уж точно игре на пользу не идет. 

Ландсраад, который позиционируется разработчиками как Endgame-контент просто неинтересно делать. В общем итоге он представляет собой просто 25 заданий, которые завязаны либо на убийстве огромного количество болванчиков-мобов, либо доставке своему Дому предметов. Баланса при этом почти нет - тебе могут выдавать 600 очков за доставку единицы какого-то мусора, который можно собрать в начальных локациях, и давать 6 очков за доставку пряности - самого ценного предмета в игровой вселенной. Нужно ли говорить, что заниматься этим просто нет смысла и такие задания висят до конца недели? 

А еще у нас есть замечательная механика, которая показывает топ гильдий, которые внесли максимальный вклад в победу Дома. Вот только этот топ ничего не дает, кроме как отображает ваш итоговый вклад. Никаких наград, никаких бонусов, даже никаких скинов для брони вам не положено. 

В игре даже нет ежедневных и еженедельных квестов, которые есть во многих ММО и которые позволяют игрокам задерживаться в игре подольше. 

Чего еще в игре нет - нет каких-то наград за PvP - убийства других игроков только ради убийства, нет каких-то гильдейских активностей (вот представьте, как было бы круто иметь где-нибудь на мировой карте свою цитадель, собирать ресурсы, готовиться к осадам и обороне, ведь с точки зрения лора тут есть где развернуться), нет данжей с механиками, а не мобавми-болванчиками, в которые можно было бы ходить группой и много-много другого, что есть в других играх. В итоге у игры есть просто огромный потенциал, который по максимуму не используется. 

Если бы можно было поставить нейтральный обзор, я бы выбрал его. Я не могу сказать, что игра плохая, или что она не заслуживает внимания. Funcom действительно проделали отличную работу над вселенной и сюжетом, проходить начальные локации было очень интересно, и у игры есть просто огромный потенциал! Но сейчас после прохождения квестов и основного сюжета, и пары полетов в Глубокую пустыню можно уже заниматься каким-нибудь строительством крутой базы (чем я и занимался) и заходить пару раз в неделю для того, чтобы заправить генераторы на базе и заплатить нологи!

Сейчас перед разработчиками стоит важная задача - как с учетом успешного старта с миллионом проданных копий (!) не потерять потенциал проекта и не растерять всех игроков. Если у разработчиков получится провести работу над ошибками, то Dune: Awakening может стать одной из лучших представителей жанра и уж точно лучшей игрой по Дюне.",0.0,1752880343,True,1172710

"I felt the opening HOUR was uninspired cinematics with very little actual playing time. KCD1 had a better intro story, more gripping. KCD1, yes, had a high learning curve for everything (riding, fighting, etc.), but in KCD2, I'm supposed to already be established as a knight, yet 4 hours into the sequel, I can't even beat a dog even though I have a sword. That's pretty stupid, frankly. Combine that with the ridiculous Saviour Schnapps save game method being perpetuated...is beyond frustrating. I loathe having to find or craft an item to save my progress, especially when you may have last saved 30 minutes ago and have to run miles back and redo actions. It can take 3 hours to complete a single side encounter. I guess they want you to suffer in lieu of actual enjoyment of the game. Shouldn't be that way. That is an abysmal and horridly frustrating waste of my gaming time. I'm liking some of this sequel--it looks great and has its moments--but hating on it quite a bit. Could be easily fixed by freeing up saves without the contrived Schnapps thing. Also the dialogue is incredibly insipid and boring. Every interaction takes up minutes skipping through text choices that seem hopelessly bound to 2010. Overall, even though I'll continue playing it out (maybe), I'm giving this a very hefty thumbs down. If you loved KCD1 as I did, maybe consider not wasting your time on KCD2, you'll only be aggravated and disappointed. The mechanics are so slack, it's like a prequel--there is zero improvement in game play (it's gotten worse, imho).",-0.06600198412698413,1752877321,False,1771300

"This game's a banger, Absolute buy! 

I've played over 40 hours doing mostly secondary quests! Literally haven't been to the wedding yet!!
WARNING: It's freaking HARD in the beginning (and it hints maybe too easy by the endgame), but when you start, you literally have NOTHING, you're not even a beggar bro. So prepare for a few beatings. (Interesting)
So, needless to say, I still have plenty of game ahead to experience although it seems I'll be done with secondary quests quite soon, that gives you a sense of how long the run can be. 

I'd say this game is a solid 9/10, if we go to fractions, 9.5/10. 
It's not perfect but it gets close to it in many aspects. 

It's only fair to note that the amount of things well done is HUGE it'd take too much to note everything, special recognition to the absence of common bugs, great storytelling, game design, dialogues, random encounters and merchants, etc. But I want to provide a list of what bothers me or what can be significantly BETTER and hopefully someone in the dev teams gets to read it. 

• Inventory management, It's kinda painful to browse the inventory once you have a sizeable amount of items, specially if you're using a controller instead of mouse and keyboard. Too many items (too many kinds of arrows, too many kinds of foods, too many kinds of potions) that variety certainly gives flavor to the game, but inventory NEEDS to be approached. Out of 40 hours of gameplay, I don't think i exaggerate by saying 10 or 12 are purely dedicated to inventory management, that's too much!

• Lack of professions; It honestly looks a lot like this was going to be part of the game at a certain point and devs just got rid of the idea, Maybe coming as a DLC (?) hopefully... Fishing is the most noticeable of them all, there are fishes and crabs as food, piers, fishing rods, fishing spots in the map, fisher's clothes but you can't be a fisherman. The same similarly applies to woodworking/carpentry and to be a tailor or a jeweler. The alchemy and the blacksmith mini games are so fun! Including more professions with specific goals to achieve could be huge!

• I think it'd be great if there were houses or parcels of land for sale, even a few, 2 or 3 in the whole map. You can still purchase a bed or a room in a tavern or the game story gives you a room somewhere. But I feel like building your own house in the game would be such a massive source of fun. Like, I'd like to exhibit a shield or a unique weapon in a wall that's part of a quest but not quite good to carry it on me. Maybe another DLC (?)

• Try to escalate NPC difficulty, in the start, I'd bet that you can somehow lose a fight to a rabbit. Later on, the unique perks of the ""skill tree"" or ""level up system"" can make you unrealistically overpowered. It's really cool to note progress but this is not zero to hero, is more zero to hacker. 

• The flowers are a very important component of the game, but even with ultra graphics, their textures are flat, ugly, it's like the art doesn't fit in the world the same as the rest of things. 

And that's it, again, close to perfect, definitely a buy, comparable to a 2025 medieval Skyrim.

"Lots of positives about the game but also a lot of negatives. However I believe that the positives outweigh the negatives, and it makes me excited for the second game they announced as the negatives are very fixable. (I 100% the game)
Some Highlights from both the good and bad:

Good:
-Combat/Game-play is very fun and rewarding (Parry, perfect dodge, Blink, Repulse)
-Descent amount of customization with the type of builds you can do (I did a speed build)
-Hit boxes are very good as you can dodge attacks by slightly being under or over them (happens more than you think)
-Most Bosses are very fun and have awesome music including the DLC ones
-Music is very good (few have made it into playlist)
-Attractive main character with lots of customization (except hair) 
-Eve (main character) is done very well while she is fighting in the game from the animations to the voice work
-Fun collection system with the soda cans
-Interesting cliffhanger

Bad:
-Most of the writing for the main story is meh except for the end of the game where it gets interesting
-Writing for the characters and their interactions is mostly weird or straight makes no sense. The biggest one I want to point out is Eve and Tachy's relationship. You are supposed to feel for them but you just don't because of the screen time and writing between the two.
-Don't hate any of the characters but also don't love any of them as well
-80-90% of side quest or just bad or mid
-movement is little clunky outside of combat
-Dialogue/cut-scenes are very weird about skipping on second play through (some are some are not)
-Level design feels uninspired until the final area (Spire 4)

The game has incredible music a deep story and great parry dodge based combat. The game play/ exploration and combat is like DMC meets souls and Neir Automata. The collectibles each have something fun about getting them such as the cans and their animations or the outfits being fairly unique and fun to gather. the only critique i have is that the voice acting in the first half can be clunky.

"Amazing theme, amazing combat, amazing game. But uhm, about Veronique's rocket-hammer, why can't I loot it off the ground? The best looking weapon in the game(which has human moveset btw) is off limits for some strange unknown reason which pisses me off to the core. Anyway the rocket-lance was a very nice alternative and the gun -blade too. Oh yeah forgot to say this is dlc weapons. Base game dosent dabble in the explosive power of explosions as much as the dlc, but ya still have the heavy hitters like the big pipe wrench and Zeus lightning hammer.

"Je suis atrocement déçu par leur décision de mettre en vente des points d’apprentissage. J’ai joué pendant très longtemps des MMOs, peu m’ont tenu en haleine dans leur capacité à faire un monde persistent ou peut coexister le PVE et le PVP… Albion faisait partie de la liste, jusqu’à hier.

Je veux comprendre qu’ils aient peut-être des problèmes d’argent, mais dans un jeu ou TOUT est fait par les joueurs, mettre en ventre les points d’apprentissage n’est pas juste accélérer un processus. Mêler cela au système de Premium (qui allait je trouve) mènera à du PVP ou le portefeuille va être l’arme forte, ce qui mènera ceux qui veulent avoir une suprématie (après tout, on pouvait déjà acheter de l’or, qui permettait d’acheter de l’argent), à accepter dans leurs guildes d’autres qui vont aller utiliser le portefeuille par commodité parce qu’ils veulent gagner, ce qui n’est pas un mal mais qui n’aura rien de méritant et c’est tout le jeu qui va mourir.  
Je déconseille ce jeu, tant qu’ils ne seront pas revenus sur leur décision, désigner le responsable de la mise à mal d’une des meilleurs jeu en ligne cross-play / cross-platform pour éviter qu'il prenne un décision désastreuse dans ce domaine, ce jeu et n'importe quel autre à l'avenir. 

J’aime ce jeu, je ne veux pas qu’il meure parce qu’encore une fois l’avarice est montée à la tête de certains individus et n’ont pas réfléchi à une solution plus saine vis-à-vis de comment le jeu fonctionne !

"Hello everyone,

I used to really like playing ESO.  I have been playing ESO since 2017.  Then, Last Friday, 7/11/25, it just stopped working.  After a week of back and forth, ESO told me I needed to update my version of Windows.  Keep in mind, over the 8 years, I have spent lots of money with Steam/ESO/Zenimax.  Then, they FORCE an update on me that kills the game dead (like my toon on more than one occasion).  Now, if I want to play the game again, after I have spent all that money ($$$$) on already, I have to update my PC; so they can graciously allow me to play their game again,  I spent a bunch of money to,just to have it flushed down the toilet until I can get my computer updated, because some genius at ESO/STEAM/Zenimax decided that they would stay ahead of the curve.   I am no longer a happy ESO/STEAM/Zenimax customer.  If ESO/STEAM/Zenimax actually cared about it's customer base, then I don't think they should be throwing their customers under the buss.  BTW ESO/STEAM/Zenimax, WOW, DDO, BL2, BL3, BL-Pre-Sequal, SWTOR,........ still plays just fine.  Maybe I will spend my money on them instead of ESO..",-0.03734567901234568,1752876131,False,306130

"I think the game is great, it has crossplay and it has a very large modded community, and everyday it seems the Vanilla game is getting more players too because they see how fun the simplistic nature of cold war era can be. A lot of the players can help create real immersive moments, and when speaking together and working together this game truly shines. Even as someone who usually goes solo for my games, its always fun to stick with a group on here for a few hours. 

Things I want to see improved:
Ground deformation; simple enough, big boom create crater. 
Squad gameplay; currently everyone goes into their own squad because squad leaders can be seen on the map, however this takes away from Squad based tactics using radio bags and not using the platoon channel for small talk. 
Medical Update; Id like to see Medical bags become a deployable item similar to radio bags and act and a on-the-spot medical site, right now you can only heal injuries near med stations, a med van, or chugging morphine. Medics need to be more impactful and actually efficient with their tools. 
Rocket nerf; it feels like everyone is running rockets because they are a answer to any problem, making armor hard to use. (I understand thats the point, but its to the point you dont ever use an LAV or BTR because it puts you at a disadvantage in most areas on Vanilla maps) Anyone inside a BTR or LAV get knocked out or killed outright by a single rocket to the front where all the armor should be yet receiving near max casualties.

"I've sunk hours into V Rising and I absolutely love it. The mix of survival, base building, and action RPG mechanics is incredibly well balanced. The vampire theme is done perfectly. From feeding on enemies to building your gothic castle. Combat is fluid and fun, the world feels alive, and the progression is super satisfying. Whether you're playing solo or with friends, there's always something to do and explore. Highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys survival games with a dark twist. Easily one of my favorite games this year.

"As a pretext, I am a predominantly MnK player who has played and done very well on controller before, as it isn't really a challenge to. I would consider myself a very high level player as I've dropped multiple 30+ kill games on Warzone BR Solos and probably am top of a multiplayer lobby 95% of the time. Onto the review.

Ricochet anti-cheat: does absolutely nothing. Even if it did, aim assist is essentially just legal aim bot anyway. They said it themselves: a mass majority of reports are on console players, who in almost all cases are incapable of being able to hack, at least compared to PC players. This can only mean that players are reporting people because of their inhuman cheat-like aim that is gifted to them for squeezing the left stick on their baby rattle.

Movement: ""New evolution of movement"" only lasted about 2 weeks on launch until they nerfed all of it to the ground. Feels clunky and slow for being marketed as a fast paced arcade shooter. If you want movement, play literally any other game at least until jet packs come back or something.

Gun-play: feels abysmally horrible for anyone who has to actually see what they are aiming at to hit bullets. They did multiple pass-throughs for visual recoil and it is still nearly impossible to track a target without the game doing it for you. Additionally, every action requires you to put your gun down for 5 seconds which only makes it harder to play aggressively and have any fun whatsoever.

Nearly zero gun balancing other than nerf every gun people like and buff new battle pass guns temporarily so that people buy tiers or bundles. Nearly every ""weapon patch"" is increasing damage range on a class of guns by 1.4 meters and nothing else.

Monetization: Somehow worse than supply drops. I'd gladly play one or two games for a supply drop for a chance at cool loot than be constantly be berated over and over again to spend $30 on Stan Smith, Beavis and Butthead, and the Ninja Turtles. I'd maybe sort of understand if the whole game was free to play, but it isn't. ""At least you know what you're getting"" no one cares when you are paying $30 for a skin you use for 2 days and a weapon blueprint for a gun that gets nerfed the next day. Not to mention you literally can't see the operator you spend money on as it is a first person game. I'll always stand by AWs supply drop system since it was the most customization of any COD and you got a supply drop literally every game.

Progression: No progression except for level (means nothing other than weapon unlocks and showing play time to others) and camos. Camos would be cool if they weren't made incredible easy to get compared to older cods. I managed to get Dark Matter and Nebula in the first month without even trying. Same with MW2 and MW3. Warzone was more difficult but now you can just farm bots so you can do it in literally 2 days if you wanted.

Matchmaking: Mainly talking about multiplayer here, as Warzone's matchmaking is more forgiving due to needing 150 players. It's basically impossible to kick back and enjoy a game unless you suck major ass at the game and don't care to do well at all. It used to be do good one game, get cooked for the next couple. Now it's just get cooked the whole time. I just played around 10 matches in a row. Each one only consisting of prestige master players using the same weapon (LC10) snaking the objective for the win while I'm just trying to complete a challenge for an event.

Warzone: Usually a buggy mess. Currently the only map for BR is Verdansk which is extremely boring as it is now a 5 year old map with no new points of interest or any good quality of life updates. Same with Rebirth, but even worse somehow as it is literally the same exact map that we got 4 years ago. Servers are usually trash as well, so much for ""ping is king"". Since it's free and there is no anti cheat, expect cheaters nearly every game. Do not play ranked. Just don't.

Basically, the game sucks. BO6 is a bottom 5 COD, MW3 was ok, and MW2 is a bottom 1 COD. Activision's greed and whatever the hell is happening at the developer studios has ruined Call of Duty if not forever, at least for the foreseeable future. The only real hope for this franchise to release actual good games is a change of upper management as well as a major change in the lazy, greedy, and insanely mindless way that the games are made. As well as, of course, a working anti-cheat and a nerf to aim assist.

TLDR: DONT BUY THIS GAME ITS NOT FUN AT ALL WAIT FOR SLEDGEHAMMER GAME IN 2027 HOPEFULLY ITS GOOD.",0.012748421717171724,1752828718,False,1962663

   I can't even describe all of my emotions that I got playing it. Combat, music, atmosphere, characters, sceneries, graphics it all left an imprint in my mind.

Emotional and psychological improvement that Kratos had, was so beautiful that I even dropped a tear in the last scene from main game.

"Ark will be Ark; all games have issues and unfortunately Ark - and this applies to both Survival Evolved and Survival Ascended - has been plagued with optimization issues and the near-guaranteed issues after any major update. That is not something I believe anyone is denying. However you can't take all the possible issues and compare them to your experience. Mine has been pretty light in terms of issues or bugs encountered, and definitely within reason for any game I would play (and at the time of this writing, the game is still within Early Access.)

Ark has held a special place in my list of games ever since it's initial release while I was on a shoddy laptop. I would recommend this game to anybody who enjoys Survival games. It's spin on the genre - and the inclusion of Big Reptile - make it an experience even if you play casually. I would recommend any new players hold off on any Flying mounts until they really explore the map, it's gorgeous and such a different experience on the ground than the detached feel you eventually get flying over the map. A gorgeous flight, but you tend to get into that Autopilot of just going from A to B. Walk around, die to Raptors a couple hundred times, live the Ark experience.

For fans of Evolved, Ascended has taken Evolved and made it gorgeous, The enhancements to the UI and certain QoL features make this game an amazing remaster. The integrated modding system is far easier than the previous methods for solo play and managing a Server. There is more of a monetary system for certain mods, but the Free original DLC was a great choice and all the better that they reintroduce new DLC and Content that you can buy to enhance your experience for those who want more than a basic remaster. Whether you're looking for an experience solo, or with friends, there's so much this game has to offer, I find all these arguments of ""Pay-to-win"" are null. It doesn't detract from the base experience unless you're looking to hop into Official. At which point Ark has the same experience you'd associate with Rust servers in terms of the tribes you will likely meet. , maybe catch it on the next Sale and if it's not for you - so be it.",0.0933869425148495,1752879515,True,2399830

"Ceu fiquei muito impressionado em como No Man’s Sky melhorou muito com o tempo. Quando joguei pela primeira vez, confesso que foi meio decepcionante. O jogo era meio sem graça, NPC's vazios, muitos bugs, algumas mecânicas não funcionavam depois de um tempo eu voltei pra dar uma chance e... nossa, mudou da agua pro vinho, te juro
Hoje em dia posso dizer que: é o melhor jogo de exploração espacial que existe. Os desenvolvedores realmente cuidam do game, da pra ver que eles amam o que estão fazendo, o que pra mim que tbm sou dev, chega a ser emocionante. Toda hora tem atualização nova, coisa melhorando, conteúdo sendo adicionado... é bonito de ver mano.

O que mais gosto é a sensação de estar sozinho naquele universo gigante, é intimidador e ao mesmo tempo um convite pra desvendar aquela imensidão. Ficar viajando de planeta em planeta, lendo arquivos antigos, descobrindo coisas sobre outras raças, enfrentando as sentinelas quando dá vontade de confusão... ou só melhorando minha nave e os equipamentos... ha e você vai aprendendo a se comunicar com outras raças tbm. E mano, dá até pra ter uma frota inteira de naves(fragatas)!! Depois dessa atualização que adicionou frotas, pra onde eu vou eu ""pouso"" minha nave capital bem na atmosfera do planeta, ai ela vem no hiperespaço e em seguida as fragatas... puts q visão.
O jogo te dá uma liberdade absurda. Você faz o que quiser, no seu ritmo, do seu jeito tlg. 
É realmente um universo inteiro pra explorar, e chega a arrepiar.

Se você curte explorar, ficar de boa no espaço, descobrir mistérios e montar suas próprias aventuras, eu recomendo demais!!! E para os que gostam de jogar com amigos, da pra jogar multiplayer, e entre plataformas tambem(eu jogo com meu amigo pelo PC e ele no PS4). em fim, recomendo forte!

"This game is fun, is it worth 40$ I wouldn't say so. A lot of it is the same, new enemies sure, and a few new toys but the same skills, performance problems, etc. Thankful since the game is so short (half or less than the first game) you start with each ability (2 levels in each skill at the start). I get it's a ""DLC"" but personally get on discount, still fun tho.

The finishers are very limited, there's only like 5 types and whenever you do one it cuts to a cut-scene of it being performed, but they get old quick, sometimes you don't even get a change to use them in areas they're in because how far they are from enemies, especially on harder difficulties.

The new weapons are very fun, and you get to use the bigger more exciting weapons more often huge plus, [spoiler] your auto-9 also gets a awesome new board near the end that just demolishes everything. [/spoiler] I feel like they added many hub areas to the game, but they server no purpose then to talk to a few npcs from before. Personally I feel like they should've had more to-do for these areas, It's definitely a far more linear then the first. Another rant is the difficulty hard and extreme they aren't, different Dev's definitely worked on different areas, sometimes there's healing items between each room, and other area's they're few and far between. 

The ending is anti-climatic, the final mission is just a few small objectives, then a run to get to the top and catch the big bad. They hype up this big drone robot, so bad you don't want to run into it ever but... [spoiler] There is no drone boss, its a few rooms with it flying around the tower shooting at you while some grunt waves bother you, but since the drone is so strong (basically and ED that flies) it just kills the enemies for you, no joke half the time its not shooting you but the other grunts. You end up just disabling it and it crashes and that it, no fight not really dodging it or anything, just kinda mozing on the final floor. [/spoiler] Finally you reach the big bad and... [spoiler] A cut-scene plays RoboCop is so cool he stops his escape, oh boy maybe there's another drone, or he has some ""Macguffin"" or something but no he gets up they talk for a moment and you have some slow mo event where you have to shoot him, he dies the end roll credits, no post story, no what happened after, just credits, back to main menu.[/spoiler] The final few missions felt rushed development, I'm sure they had ideas to add a boss, etc. but it falls flat at the end.

There is no new game plus, although I personally didn't have a reason to do a new game plus, just a downside compared to the first game. I do think if there's no new game plus, I should be able to max out every skill, maybe you could but i couldn't.

The achievements are just like the first game, a few you get from exploring but generally you're getting most of them just playing the game, I feel the Dev's could add a few that are more difficult. I had one bugged achievement [spoiler] Part Man, Part Machine, All Correct [/spoiler] I did this achievement many times but it just didn't proc.

Performance is a huge issue, for a game like this, it really shouldn't struggle at all, I played through it but having to use dlss just to get 20fps in some areas is really bad optimization. I feel many places was just poorly optimized. Sometimes I get somewhere before the game could load, when this happens I can see outside the map, and see many things just loading outside that you can't see and shouldn't be loaded, Spinning in a circle drops frames heavy, many times looking in certain directions just shits on performance, if you destroy too much details in a area it drop performance heavy too. this has been an issue since the first game. thinking they spent time on this ""DLC"" they could look into optimizations and engine upgrades, plug some memory leaks, etc. The guns even have unnecessary details modeled, that you wouldn't see during normal game-play. [spoiler] It really sucks when they added a new enemy, a robot drone that are basically moving landmines, they chase you after sometimes if you don't destroy them. The issue is when the game starts chugging and you can't aim properly because of the performance issues they explode on death, not only that if they're more then one in a room, you shoot one others around it activate, and start honing in on your location. I've died a few times because my games starts chugging and I can't aim at them properly. [/spoiler] This is on a 4th gen m.2,  4060ti, 32gb of ram, Ryzen 5 5600x, and it chugs still with dlss with frame generation, crazy. 

Any-who I had fun playing it, I loved the first game with all it's downsides with performance, this game would be a a lot, I mean a lot better if the performance issues were fixed. I would recommend it if they did.

"[h1]🛑 DEAD OR ALIVE - YOU ARE CRASHING WITH ME! 🛑[/h1]

As previous title, it's Robocop in and out.
Sure they went a bit stylistic about the environmental design being more of Futuristic Brutalism, Concrete, steel, and hard angular forms. Less of neighborhoods, factories etc etc, pretty sure you can see the screenshots from the game.
That might make the game feel more strict in terms of where to go what to do unlike previous game, which let you roam around a whole block and go to different environments, salvage yard, police station, prison, THE f***ing OCP TOWER.

However if you are expecting the same levels of environmental changes, you will be wanting for more.

Environmental rant is over, now about the game itself:

[u][b]✅ THE Good:[/b][/u]
[b]🔹 Robocop[/b]

[b]🔹 Shooting holds up.[/b] Same as the last game. Punchy, loud, bodies react like being hit with a train.
Doesn’t reinvent anything, but it doesn’t need to.

[b]🔹 Environmental storytelling is solid.[/b] You get bits and pieces from the RoboCop universe scattered naturally. A lot is reused from the previous game, but it's placed well and doesn’t feel lazy.

[b]🔹 Performance is fine.[/b] On a 9800X3D with a 3070 Ti, I’m getting 90–100 FPS on Epic with DLSS on Quality. No AMD Framegen toggle sadly, but the game runs smooth on my end. (Samsung 990 Pro, 32gb Ram - 6000)

[b]🔹 Voice Acting & Sound Design.[/b] Peter Weller’s return still carries weight. His lines have that classic cold delivery, and the audio mix in general makes it feel great and authentic.

[b]🔹 Side gigs break up the action decently.[/b] Some police work, some crowd control, adds just enough variety between the corridor shootouts.

[u][b]❌ The BAD:[/b][/u]
[b]⚠️ As a narrative expansion (standalone DLC),[/b] it plays too safe. The structure and pacing closely mirror the original game, without offering much evolution in gameplay or mission variety. It's the previous game but you are dropped in Judge Dredd Mega Tower. Big building overrun by baddies, and you are cleaning the house. Go figure.

[b]⚠️ Level design is overly familiar.[/b] You will be going through a lot of tunnels, doing a lot of door breaches with 3 second slow-mo just to kill a couple of dudes behind the door, a large portion is reused content with minor edits, which limits the sense of exploration or surprise.

[b]🤖 Enemy AI[/b]
This is a big one, and quite important one.
Most enemies follow the same basic script: spot Robocop, shout something like ""HEY IT'S THE COP!"" then sprint directly into gunfire in which the only outcome is being shot in the balls. There's no sense of fear, flanking, or survival instinct.
They rarely take cover or reposition. Even when cover is available, enemies often stand in the open or awkwardly walk into line of sight, making firefights feel like shooting range.

Imagine you're just some thug with a floppy AK or worse, a 9mm SMG. And suddenly, a solid block of titanium with a gun bigger and harder than anything you've had in the morning kicks down your door. What do you do? These guys walk straight into it and die like it's their sole purpose in life. At this point pain them silver and give them all a voiceline ""WITNESS MEE!!!""

[b]TLDR:[/b] Combat loses its edge fast. Once you realize the enemy will never outsmart you, encounters become routine. Even high-damage enemies don’t feel dangerous, they're just damage sponges with no awareness.

[b]🔫 Auto-9 (Robocop Gun)[/b]
The Auto-9 is too strong for what the game throws at you. One-shot kills, even on heavily armored enemies, paired with infinite ammo and oversized mags, strip any need for strategy or weapon variety. I understand Robocop was lethal in the films, but he was gunning down thugs, not full body armored mercs.
Here, you’re pistol whipping literal military tier enemies like they’re made of paper. If you're going to stretch realism, give us his machine gun arm from Robocop 3 or something. And the option to pick up enemy weapons just feels wrong, Robocop never did that. It breaks character and cheapens the fantasy.

[b]P.S.[/b] The only time RoboCop used another weapon in the films was the Cobra Assault Cannon in the first movie, and that was a one-time, story-driven moment. He didn’t loot it off a thug mid-fight lol.

[b]💥 The crashes.[/b]
It's not much to say, the game crashes. And i am not the only one, again major slip up on behalf of QA team, if they have a QA team at Teyon even.
However just play the game for 1-2 hours at once and you are guaranteed to have a crash, no matter what you do.
Could it be my 8 gb of VRAM? I don't know. Nvidia Drivers? Unreal Engine 5? Biggest nature's mystery.
It's playable and not very infuriating considering auto-save exists.
Also I played on the release, so I am sure they will iron it out soon with fixes and patches.",0.0032938203771537087,1752878615,True,3527760

"Kenshi can oddly be summarized as Morrowind, if you removed all of the quests from the game, replaced every cliff racer with daedric enemies, and then add in awful performance that cause constant loading screens from running around the map alongside bugs and other issues that will delete half of your base, get your characters killed or even remove them entirely, break your saves outright and sometimes just crash your game when trying to load a save. It's unfortunately a deceptively shallow game that is held together with rubber bands. 

There is a lot going on in the World of Kenshi according to dialogue from its inhabitants, but in reality its all barren and artificial. There are several different factions that have their own issues and conflicts but they are all confined to their own little bubbles and will never reach out beyond them unless you force them too, which just results in a few different npcs spawning in different areas. You can run around and explore the handful of towns spread out across this very large, dead world, and all you'll find are npcs that are flagged to fight other npcs and a few unique characters with barely a paragraphs worth of dialogue. You can interact with all of these happenings by getting beat up by bandits, or trading items that can't be used by npcs to merchants who, in the non existent economy, restock their wallet and inventory every day, or sneak around and steal from said merchants, and that's really it. There are copy and pasted ruins to find with items tailored for the tech tree research and junk that can't be used for anything other than selling, but otherwise nothing interesting to find. No underground arenas to participate in, no local attractions to sight see, no gathering of nobility to make fun of the poor, nor any grand cathedrals with altars for the pious to grovel beneath. Just more desert and more towns filled nearly identical shops and inns.

Engaging with these few activities Kenshi has to offer isn't that meaningful either. The game functions mostly like an RTS so everything plays itself with the only real input from the player being minor positioning and kiting which isn't even that necessary. This creates a very boring gameplay loop that overstays its welcome due to the slow and one dimensional ways to level up your characters. Leveling up any of your characters major skills in combat, crafting, etc. will take dozens of hours if you don't explicitly focus on grinding them and have other priorities than just fighting the locals, or crafting the same cheap gear while you sit on your phone or fight the games performance issues trying to do other in game tasks. You could circumvent the grind by amassing a large number of people, but then comes the issue of annoying micromanaging of inventories, hunger and combing over everyone to check their health. Really the only thing left is the base building side of the game, but that highlights the abysmal ai pathfinding with characters getting stuck on rocks, phasing through walls and getting stuck, or just not doing anything because a small box in the back corner of the room is blocking them from entering the building at all, or the rudimentary job system causing logistical standstills with your workers just not doing things sometimes.

There is charm in its ideas and passion behind its creation, but Kenshi, devoid of the abstract, is just a mechanical and technical mess that feels like its wasting your time by pretending its ambition and scope are reality while gating the meaningful and interesting content with a tedious grind that prevent's you from fully experiencing the world presented and hiding most of it in nooks and crevices that blend in with identical ruins and lifeless structures.",-0.03795961422543703,1752877274,False,233860

"It's mid.
Puzzles were a little under my expectations. The initial idea of perspective to create puzzles is great but it's not very well used. Puzzles feel same-ish and challenge is mostly absent. It has that usual puzzle game problem of devs creating a mechanic, struggling to use it to create interesting puzzles, give up and just do another mechanic. It means you will be doing mostly the same puzzle over and over again but with different constraints (one time you can't choose where you take the photo, one time you are limited in the number of photos taken, etc.)

Story was also sub-par. I don't think I even understood what it was all about, it's mostly people you don't see arguing on recording with other people you don't see. And an annoying cat.

Where is shines is in the filters, the pictures and the structures you evolve in. It sometimes have a vibe.

It is a surprisingly-well-balanced game.

Graphics are a bit underdeveloped, but it might be for ambience. Music is very upbeat-dark-ages. Combat is between simple and complex depending on your party and load-out, and makes sense. The world is well-designed.  

To date, (52 hours of play time) the only glitch I've found is a character which has twice escaped me and been re-captured, then turned in to a jail, is still in my encampment and can be assigned to a position, but from which I seem to gain nothing.

Mechanically, the third dimension most directly sees its use in stacking shapez onto each other, but it also adds another dimension in which to weasel your way through having boxed yourself in. It adds a delightful frisson to the experience.

Aesthetically, there is a charming vibe of space combined with something like a plastic construction kit like you might have played with as a child.

This is the peak of what I’ve seen in the gaming industry. I’ve never encountered a more compelling story and storytelling in any game.

CD Projekt Red are masters of visual and interactive storytelling.

"This game totally sucked me in. I got it thinking, “Oh cool, I’ll build a cute zoo and vibe with the animals.” Next thing I know, it’s 2 am and I’m googling what pets go well together in google.

Planet Zoo is genuinely one of the best management/building games I’ve played. The animals are ridiculously detailed—like, they have personalities and little quirks, and it makes your zoo feel alive. I’ve caught myself just sitting there watching the elephants play in the water. No shame.

The building system is super powerful. It’s not easy at first (honestly, it humbled me), but once you figure it out, you can make some insane stuff. Total creative freedom. Want to build a fully themed rainforest sanctuary with custom signs and ambient sounds? Go for it. Want to just plop down pre-built stuff and focus on running the zoo? That works too.

What I didn’t expect was how much thought goes into caring for the animals. You have to learn what each species needs to be happy—terrain, space, food, social groups, enrichment, all of it. It’s detailed, but in a fun, addicting way. Also, there’s conservation goals and education stuff woven in, which I actually really liked. Makes it feel meaningful, not just like a zoo tycoon game from 2004.

Is it perfect? Not quite. The interface can feel a little overwhelming at first, and building with 1,000 pieces can get a little fiddly. But the game keeps getting updated, and the community is awesome if you ever need help or inspiration.

If you’re into animals, building sims, or just want to create your dream zoo (and stress about habitat temperatures), this game is 100% worth it. Highly recommend.",0.1585725308641975,1752860678,True,703080

Para quem gostou do jogo Base acha que a dlc nao vale a pena pelo preco sim esta salgada o valor mais eu compraria para mim presentiar se caso gostasse.

Sobre o GAME:  implementando novas armas , quest legais tambem. Oque eu achei mais fodastisco foi ter a volta ao passado suas descorbertas , A lea acho que foi uma peca bem legal entre todos do jogo bonita,estilosa e uma bela espreitadora , mas outra personagem me deixou intrigante no caso a Rosalia pelo que eu entendi ela vivia ou esteve presente por Krat mas como ela foi tomada por titeres nao durou muito , acredito que o passado ficou mais conectado com a historia principal do que o proprio jogo Base oque e claro em uma DLC simplesmente achei muito fodaaaa.
 As barracas de jogos,  as manilevas deixadas tambem acho que nao da pra passar batido esses detalhes pra quem quer curtir o jogo , sem ruchar e maraviloso obrigado Round8 e Neowiz Games que OBRA PRIMA!!! TOOOP DE MAISSSSSSS...

极化了本体的特点，更多且更视觉丰富的袖珍黑魂地图、更多需要弹反处理的敌人，如果喜欢本体，那么这就是个中杯上的DLC；而想我一样，对本体并无太多好感的玩家，只会觉得更加恶心。地图立体但是单连通，公式化添加一个只对打BOSS有意义的捷径，刚准备探索就发现已经结束了；机械式的利用弹反替代了血源的枪法，但却本身弹反机制却做不到枪反这样低风险，又不像只狼有多条命的容错，敌人又增加了很多追击攻击来强迫你用弹反。初见我打每个敌人都有30%概率无伤打死，30%概率消耗1~2瓶药打过，30%概率被一脚踢死，外加10%被踢死后直接 ALT+F4退游,0.0,1752853062,False,2848330

"Depois do anúncio do remake, fiquei com bastante vontade de conhecer Persona 4, até então eu havia jogado o 5 e 3, mas sempre vi por aí muitas pessoas (muitas mesmo) dizendo como elas preferiam este jogo, sendo por seus personagens, história, música, vibes, etc. Depois de ter zerado, consigo entender completamente de onde todo esse amor vem, assim como os outros jogos da franquia, esse jogo tem aquele mesmo [u]carisma[/u] dos outros, sabe? Esse joghttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1113000/Persona_4_Golden/#o com certeza deixou uma marca em mim, assim como os outros deixaram.

Os personagens com certeza são o ponto mais alto desse jogo, todos os seus companheiros são bem presentes durante a história, e com exceção de um, todos são bem agradáveis de fazer os social links e assistir eles interagindo entre si, esse jogo inteiro passa uma vibe muito mais ''alegre'' do que todos os outros e você sente bastante isso em todo mundo. Eles tem bastante aquela energia de ''amizade boba de amigos de um anime de escola'' e mesmo que isso dava uma cansada em alguns pontos da história, eu ainda curti.

Dito isso, [spoiler]Meu Deus como eu fiquei de saco cheio do Teddie várias vezes. Acho que isso é simplesmente um estilo de humor que os japoneses gostam que não desce em mim, mas esse negócio de ficar, ''nossa, eu quero muito ver minhas amigas ficarem peladas e namorar com elas, haha!'' começa a encher o saco. Se fosse uma vez ou outra eu não veria problema, esses momentos fazem parte dos outros jogos também, mas depois de um tempo, parece que o Teddie só consegue abrir a boca pra falar disso, e as vezes ficava até pior já que o Yosuke entrava nessa pira junto. Depois da metade pro fim do jogo, eu só tava achando ele muito esquisitão do que qualquer outra coisa.[/spoiler] Bom, mas excluindo essa parte, gostei bastante dos personagens!

A história do jogo consegue te prende bastante, principalmente da metade pro fim, onde todas as peças do mistério começam a se encaixar, sempre que eu abria o jogo eu ficava naquela mini ansiedade pra saber o que iria acontecer em seguida, e adorei o antagonista principal, provavelmente meu personagem favorito do jogo inteiro!

Toda a estética do jogo no combate, nas músicas e quando você está só passeando na cidade construindo os social links é muito marcante, era muito normal eu simplesmente ficar balançando a cabeça no ritmo da música enquanto eu jogava. Quanto ao combate, joguei o jogo inteiro no difícil e foi um desafio bem agradável pra mim que sempre deixar os jogos um pouco mais difíceis que o normal, vencer os bosses principais era bem satisfatório.

Em geral, jogo muito bom! Entendo como esse foi o jogo que realmente colocou a Atlus no mapa e como ele conseguiu tocar tantas pessoas, se você jogou e gostou de ter jogado tanto o 3 quanto o 5, aqui tem tudo que você gosta!",0.16833333333333333,1752880187,True,1113000

"This game is a surprisingly detailed and engaging simulation experience that captures the day-to-day hustle of running a car service station. From managing fuel pumps and repairing vehicles to cleaning up messes and restocking shelves, there’s a solid loop of tasks that keeps you busy in a satisfying way. The game does a good job of gradually introducing new mechanics, and the upgrade system provides a steady sense of progression.

One thing that stood out to me is the graphics, they're genuinely impressive for a sim game. The lighting, car models, and environment design all look great and add a lot to the immersion. While there are still some clunky controls and the occasional visual bugs, none of it really detracts from the overall experience.

"[b]'후즈 앳더 도어'[/b]는 한눈에 보이는 관찰각도, 짧은 동선, 스토리와 연계되는 단서가 되는 환각과 같이 효율적인 덜어내기를 통해 짧은 플레이 타임에도 연출적인 부분을 채워넣는 여유를 보이며 시뮬레이션 시도만으로 종결되는 수많은 '8번 출구 박물관'식 게임들 사이에서 자신만의 스타일을 정립하는 부류의 게임이었습니다. 미스터리한 흐름으로 흘러가다 자연스럽게 마무리되며 다음으로 이어지는 회차 플레이에는 명확한 명분이 있었고, 큰 방해요소 없이 클라이맥스를 향해가는 구성도 좋았습니다.

공포의 형태는 뻔하지만은 않고 블러 처리 옵션(!)이 달릴 정도로 꽤 자극적인 부분도 있었습니다. 물론 그렇다고 굉장한 트라우마를 주는 수준의 공포까지는 아니고, 적당한 텐션, 적당한 징그러움, 매우 유효한 점프스케어들 몇몇이 만족감을 주는 편입니다.

환각 구분 판정에 있어서 한두군데 애매한 구간이 존재하기도 했습니다. 여기에 시간차로 판정이 바뀌는 경우도 존재했기 때문에 대체로 끝까지 확인을 하고 판단해야 했지만 플레이타임이 크게 늘어나는 부분은 아니었고, 구분 실패시에도 이상현상 카운트는 적용됐기 때문에 넘어갈 수 있습니다. 일부 지리하고 자잘한 틀린그림 찾기도 존재합니다만 적은 영역을 차지하고, 스트레스를 받거나 크게 신경쓰이지도 않습니다.

굳이 뭔가 더 궁금하거나 곱씹어보는 저같은 사람들을 제외하면 플레이 타임은 대체로 1.5~2.5시간 정도로 예상됩니다.

"I absolutely loved this game! The graphics were stunning, and the animals were incredibly cute — seriously, I couldn’t stop smiling at them. The music and sound design were top-notch and really pulled me into the world. The story had the perfect length, keeping me engaged from start to finish without dragging on. Overall, it was a super fun experience that I genuinely enjoyed.

The humor was a huge highlight for me. The AI girls were hilarious and full of personality, and the random in-game ads were so unexpectedly funny — I found myself laughing way more than I expected. It gave the game a unique charm that really stood out.

The only downside was the platforming. Sometimes when jumping between platforms, it felt like tiny ""micro-pixels"" or edge detection issues caused my character to miss the jump or fail to grab a ledge, which could be frustrating. But aside from that, everything else was fantastic!

"[h3]The protagonist of this game is probably the son of Phoenix Wright and Larry Laffer, as he constantly engages in verbal battles with hot girls and, after winning, takes the girls to bed.[/h3]

[h1]✍️Overview [/h1]
Love n Life: Happy Student is a sandbox visual novel featuring comprehensive gameplay with playable elements from RPGs, dating simulators, time/resource management, and more.
In this game, you play as a third-year college student, who manage to be transfer to the prestigious Lingyun University. 
There, the protagonist hones his conversational social skills in ""fights"" with other students, using a system of equippable items that grant ""conversation topics.""
Moreover, through these ""battles,"" the protagonist will succeed in capturing the hearts (and bedrooms) of three captivating main heroines and another 3 side heroines, with whom he engages 28 different passionate encounters, most of which feature high-quality Live 2D animations and lewd SFX, ideal for a fulfilling nighttime manual labor session.

[h3]📜Story[/h3]
The narrative is certainly not this title's strong point. It has a fairly generic university harem background with heroines who have extremely flat, stereotypical personalities. For example, there is a cheerful blonde gyaru, a serious student council president, and a seductive, busty teacher. Characters that serve to satisfy different fetishes in the game, but not for a deep story.
The progression of the story is unremarkable as well. It features typical slice-of-life events where the protagonist attends classes, helps the heroines complete tasks, and goes on dates with them.
Therefore, it is generally better not to pay too much attention to the characters' dialogues and instead enjoy the gameplay and sexual content, which undoubtedly deserve more of your attention and time.

[h3]🎮Gameplay[/h3]
This title is visually quite similar to a sandbox visual novel, as it has different locations that you can “explore” and visit via a menu/mini-map. In these locations, you will find the different heroines, who will change places depending on the day and time, as the game borrows this from the time management genre, giving the characters a routine. In addition to the heroines, you can also find NPCs in these places, who can sell you things, offer the protagonist work, or be necessary to complete side missions.
As for the gameplay itself, it is mainly divided into two mechanics. The first is dating simulation, where you have to win the affection of the heroines by giving them gifts, going on dates with them, but mainly by completing their missions, which are the most typical, such as finding them in a specific place at a certain time, buying them an item, collecting materials, etc. Once you complete the missions, you unlock the different sex scenes.
The second playable part corresponds to the RPG section, as the protagonist has different statistics, such as: impact, stamina, fortitude, impact chance, awareness, and steadfastness, which are explained in the game, but which are basically the basis for the “combat” conversations that the protagonist has with different characters. These battles are completely automatic, and the player only has to assemble the protagonist's “build,” equipping objects that grant additional stats and active combat skills. There are a total of 359 different items, so there is a wide range of options, but basically their usefulness is reduced to four different types: charm, which is characterized by powerful attacks; knowledge, which is characterized by large increases but with the possibility of harming you; confidence, for having high levels of endurance; and finally, kindness, which is characterized by allowing you to heal yourself during combat.
This item system is what really adds complexity to the gameplay and, therefore, is what can keep you entertained as you try to put together a “build” that suits your style.
It is important to note that these conversational battles, or “socialize” as the game calls them, are necessary for certain events in the main story and for the heroines, so it is important to have a powerful build as the heroines' levels will increase, making the battles more complicated.

[h3]🔞Sexual content[/h3]
[h3]Note: You need to install the +18 Free DLC or you will not see any sexual content.[/h3]
In total, this game has 28 sex scenes, all of which have animations, although 15 of these are full HD Live 2D animations and the remaining 13 are simpler animations that use the in-game character models. Fortunately, in both cases, they feature erotic sound effects and some voice dialogue.
As for the quality of these scenes, the Live 2D animations are undoubtedly infinitely better, not only because they have higher quality art that can be appreciated in full screen, but also because the movements are quite fluid and realistic and, together with the atmosphere, music, and sound effects, are extremely suggestive. The animations that use the in-game models are not bad as such, since they also have fluid animations and add an internal view of the heroine's vagina so you can see the moment of ejaculation, but I still prefer the Live 2D. Although one point to note is that despite the quality of the scenes being good, their duration is quite short, lasting a maximum of one minute.
As for the sexual fetishes present, there is not much to highlight since most fall into the vanilla category, with blowjobs, boobjobs, vaginal sex, sex toys, threesomes, public sex, bikinis, and some cosplay. So while it is enjoyable content for all players, veterans of the genre may be left wanting more.
An important point to note is that in addition to the game having a scene gallery, it can be unlocked in its entirety if you play on the “FAP” difficulty setting, so you can enjoy the good erotic content right from the start, as soon as you finish the story tutorial.

[h2]💭Conclusion[/h2]
Personally, I like this game more than Reborn Entertainment's previous release, Love n Life: Lucky Teacher, because despite having a smaller map and fewer mini-games, the gameplay is more entertaining, strategic, and not as repetitive, plus the art is no longer done with AI and looks totally incredible.
As for the sexual content, I also think the Live 2D animations are totally awesome, so I would have liked all of them to be of this type, although I suppose that with 15 of these for a price of $7, it's still a good deal.
The most notable negative points I see in this game are undoubtedly its generic story and flat heroines. I would have liked them to add others that were less atypical or at least one that had an original story with deeper touches.
That said, I have no problem recommending this game because, despite its generic college harem setup, the quality of the sexual content, its “socialize” gameplay, and its price make it a good buy, especially if you want to have entertaining late-night manual labor sessions.

the combat is whatever in here, you can just play ""walk in the park"" for the story and survival because the fighting in here it's not really good, you can 1 tap everyone with a bow and 1 single arrow to the head, the game is not really difficult after learning the basics.

after doing both endings and still finishing the Spirit story, i would recommend this if you enjoy survival, some quests are really repetitive, i mean REALLY REPETITIVE, to build something is a grind sometimes but still a fun game for the story.

"Most likely left to die, until probably the proverbial DLC, Dragon's Dogma 2 is a ca be a bit of a whimper. Carried solely by its combat and great graphics but falls quite far lore wise than expected.  On top of the weird performance issues, weird quest breaking that isn't fixable, since its an actual mechanic. 

DD2 leaves you wandering the history and scope of the world you travel in. Aside from the big quest, every side quest leaves you wanting more, and you never get it. Sometimes NPCs will show up to your house then ask you to walk them several miles across the entire map so they can give you a flower or some sh*t. please give me a ferrystone lol. 



What I did like was the exploration, but there isn't really anything to find out or anything of nuance that stays with the player. Caves feel terrifying, night even more so. 

After you reach a certain level every encounter is trivial at best. The use of light, elemental spells, are incredibly fun. The digging for materials? not fun. The story is almost there, you do cool things like meet up with the most beautiful character in gaming, dress up to sneak into a party, break into a jail but there's no stealth component so its just weird. 

NPCs are cut from the same cloth, never really say anything substantial or new. The same applies to your pawns, who ridiculously point out endlessly, that you need to read this notice on the wall, except its the same notice written, 4 hours before, and 100 hours before also.

What it does excel at is combat, and sometimes you get your ass handed to you after just powering through every encounter. The world is full of half realized ideas, there is so much here that could be found, but never is. 
The combat is great though, it feel quite good when you fight something tough. Kiting a troll or cyclops towards a bridge or into a pile of rocks. However this truly stops being unique or cool 30 hours in. The world is extremely pretty and the characters are really decent looking, just wished it had more to give. The class system is big, and includes a surprise one that really makes the game fun.

The AI of enemies is quite aggressive but not very tough after a certain point. Eventually, you will be running around or teleportation to avoid the same encounters, you'll go into this deep cave and find pretty useless gear half the time. I don't expect to strike rich every time but Jesus. I don't need them to be Dark Souls tough but overall I expected enemies to behave more erratically and unpredictably. 

What I do like is how it does not hold your hand, sometimes to a devastating extreme. Don't use an unique item, since it doesn't warn you you can only use it once. The character creator is GREAT however, depending on your build the armor can look absolutely awful, like cosplay. 

While I do think it is worth playing on a deep sale, the first year anniversary had no update, nothing new to add, the creator of it left capcom. We are sitting here still with no answers if any of the broken quests, npc's will be fixed or even adding some flair to your personal pawn to make him idk, less stupid and more quest useful. Overall, DD2 is not as lovable and interesting as the first one, considering we waited like 12 years for this sequel once that rose tinted glasses come off, it just disappointing.

Now: Should you play this game? Yeah. ""after all that you said?"" yeah. DD2 is a very rare game in a sea of soulslike and FPS. It has the right balance to where I do enjoy it even though I am criticizing it. I recommend waiting for a steep sale, and that your rig can run it.

What does this game need to make it better?
More performance optimizations.
More lore and make pawns actually useful when questing.
Obviously a DLC of some sort and not like ""collaborations""
Better armor design for custom Arisen that better fits their body type.

Overall this game is fun, but it can really punish you whether its your fault or not. It looks great, I still hate not being able to like, set ladders or something. Or like you pawn helping you by casting float. I will eventually fully finish it when we get a bit more fixes bc im almost there but didn't feel like walking to the end of the world to get another bouquet of flowers.",0.11354976841340478,1752878953,True,2054970

"Dragon’s Dogma 2 is one of those rare games that divides opinion. If it clicks with you, it might just become one of your all-time favorites. But if it’s not your thing, it could easily feel frustrating or tedious. I fell in love with the original years ago, and it’s still one of my favorite games ever. I’ve now finally completed the sequel – life got in the way at launch, but I made sure to come back to it.

From start to finish, you can feel the passion the developers poured into this world. Dragon’s Dogma 2 isn’t just another generic RPG – it’s crafted to be something special, something that values player freedom over hand-holding narratives. I spent around 60 hours just exploring before I even touched the main story. The moment the world opened up, I wandered off, chasing adventure wherever it led me. By the time I got around to the story, I was around level 40; by the time I faced the final boss, I was level 80 and obliterated him in a single strike. Sure, it was anticlimactic in one way – but it also felt completely earned, and honestly, a little funny.

And that wasn’t even the end. With the help of the mysterious “Dungeon Master” (= Pathfinder), I dove into the true ending – a final chapter that perfectly encapsulates what makes this game special. No markers, no guides – just you, your instincts, and the world. Without spoiling anything, I can say the true ending is a brilliant tribute and love letter to game design itself.

So, do I recommend Dragon’s Dogma 2? That depends on you. If you enjoy games like Dark Souls, where discovery and freedom take precedence, this might be exactly your style. If you prioritize engaging mechanics and exploration over deep storytelling, this could be a perfect fit. And if you’re simply looking for a game that feels genuinely unique, Dragon’s Dogma 2 is absolutely worth your time.

That said—if you don’t like having to figure things out yourself, or occasionally look things up online when you miss something crucial, this game probably isn’t for you. It expects you to get lost, to make mistakes, and to discover the world on your own terms. For the right player, that’s exactly the magic of it.",0.1914806547619048,1752874855,True,2054970

"I've never ridden a MotoGP bike, so I can't comment on the realism. What I can say, is that the game rewards you for learning how the bikes handle and pushing that it's limit. That is the point of any racing game attempting simulation. Whether or not they're realistic (couldn't tell you) or easier to ride than last year (I don't really detect that much of a difference, but I am also not at the top of the online lobbies) matters less to me than if they are fun and rewarding to pilot - the answer there is: yes.

It looks good and sounds good. All the teams, riders, and tracks are faithfully represented. And that's about all the good that I can say. The bare minimum has been done to deliver you a product here. Let me explain.

I own most of the MotoGP games on Steam. I have many hours in them. I have a lot of achievements. I also am avid fan of the real thing, and even ride my own motorcycle. I am *the* target demographic for this title so I feel confident that, should any devs stumble across this, they can get some insight from my review.

Career mode is frustrating. You can start in any class, but you are limited to only 4 teams in each. It does not change. This seems like a weird, arbitrary decision to make. I can jump straight to MotoGP but I can't ride for the Aspar team in Moto3? And when you do start progression, there's not a lot of feedback on whether or not you are on your desired career path. I wanted to take a ""Honda pathway"" to the top. When offers came in for MotoGP, I had to pick Trackhouse. Then after I was champion in my first season, I was not offered a ride with the *factory* Aprilia team despite just taking their customer bike to the World Championship. How does this make sense? Just let the players choose.

Moreover, the career mode could use a lot of extra depth since the empty online lobbies are certainly not what will keep you coming back to the game. Manager mode is gone and has not returned. Nor have the historical bikes. Nor the recreate-a-moment challenges. Maybe one day. 

Oh and the AI is still awful and homicidal/suicidal.

Only get it on sale, and only if you are a diehard fan. If all you want is a bike racing game, buy an older title on discount. You're not missing anything.",0.10204872646733112,1752416837,False,3077390

"JudgeSim, “Banana Republic” adlı kurgusal bir adada hakim rolüne büründüğünüz, metin tabanlı bir simülasyon oyunu. Davaları okuyor, delilleri inceliyor, sanıklarla konuşuyor ve hukuki kararlar veriyorsunuz.

Artılar:

    Sürükleyici davalar: Her vaka ilgi çekici ve dikkatli okuma, çözümleme gerektiriyor. Davalar metinle anlatıldığı için zihin gücü ön planda ve kararlar ciddi hissettiriyor .

    Tekrar oynanabilirlik: Farklı sonuçlara ulaşmak, yargılamalardaki farklı yolları keşfetmek tekrar etmek için motive ediyor .

    Minimalist atmosfer: Grafikler basit, ama bu metin odaklı oynanışa katkıda bulunuyor. Phoenix Wright kadar çarpıcı değil ama türünde başarılı

    .

Eksiler:

    Monoton müzik: Müzikler kısa ve çabuk tekrara düşüyor; bazı kullanıcılar sıkıcı bulabiliyor .

    Şans faktörü: Bazen davaların ve ceza sonuçlarının tamamen zar atışına dayandığı anlar var ki bu, temelde beceriye dayalı yargılamayla çakışabiliyor .

    Basit görsel stil: Kağıt üzerinde hazırlanmış gibi duran grafikler, bazı oyunculara “Papers, Please” benzeri ama daha zayıf bir deneyim sunuyor.",0.1,1752703993,True,2919660

"-for me the game was good enough the campaign was decently good missions were fun and was some action in them but still they dont compare to the old cods (mw2 2009,mw3 2011) 

-multiplayer mehhh didnt play so much but had potential very much potential cause mw2 2022 was kinda trash with the multiplayer and warzone so i expected much more from this one

-zombies it was unexpected to have zombies in a call of duty mw game but i enjoyed it still as i said above had potential but you could have made levels fast on the guns there and so on (nothing compares with black ops zombies btw)

-the guns,meh i mean the guns were decent lest say but i am glad they didnt make them worse

-warzone loved it the maps very nice beacuse in cod mw 2 2022 the warzone guns=trash,map=trash,metas=trash. and when i saw the gameplay and played the new warzone that launched with this game i fell in love with warzone again.

Overall the game was good had me happy after the mw2 horror but still i dont get it why so many people dont enjoy the game (my opinion is that they ask for something and thery still mad about it when they get it like spolied children)",0.13830176767676766,1752826784,True,2519060
