"A Glorious Return to the Chicken Fields

I started my PUBG journey back when it first dropped, armed with nothing but sheer willpower and a potato of a PC that barely coughed out 15 frames. Buildings took forever to render, so I'd land, stare at empty gray blobs, and if enemies dropped nearby, I’d just accept my fate and run away barefoot, weaponless, and spiritually defeated.

Fast forward 6 years, and I’ve now got a proper PC that runs PUBG on Ultra at 100+ FPS. Let me tell you, it’s like playing a completely different game. There are more gadgets, more vehicles, more chaos, and a LOT more sweaty players. The skill ceiling has shot through the roof, and yes, hackers still roam the lands, lurking like rats in the walls. But when the stars align, PUBG is unmatched.

PUBG isn’t just a game, it’s a psychological rollercoaster. You can go ten minutes in silence, heartbeat steady, only to have your soul ejected by a headshot out of nowhere. Some games you drop, grab a gun, and die in 30 seconds. Other times, you channel your inner garden gnome, sit in a bush for 25 minutes, then win with a single glorious kill. Both are valid strategies. Both are so PUBG.

Six years ago, I was hiding in buildings, panicking like a squirrel in traffic. These days, I keep moving, keep scanning, and keep hunting. I play aggressively, and it's way more fun. Win or lose, I actually see the enemy… and sometimes, I even shoot first.

There’s just something about PUBG that no other game delivers. Every match is a fresh story. No two games ever play out the same, it’s addictive chaos at its finest.

PUBG isn’t perfect, but it’s perfectly PUBG, and that’s why I love it.

"Red Dead Redemption 2 has been one of my all time favourite games to play. And we aren't just talking the Story Mode, which in itself feels massive. Even the online, assuming you got some friends, is a blast. That is, if you don't get a lobby with hackers and griefers. I managed to get 8 people to jump in to this game recently and play online with me. I was already close to 400 hours before even getting into the online gameplay. I've easily sank more into the game now that I'm playing with folks. If I could just have a Wild West Simulator that's nearly the same gameplay and style as RDR2 and RDO, I think that would do it for me.

This game will have you laughing, crying, and cursing. Sometimes all at the same time. The game is BEAUTIFUL on a 9070xt and 9700x with 64 gb DDR5 RAM. And very smooth. However, I've played through this game on a 970 back in the day. 

This game isn't meant to be rushed. You are meant to take you time exploring the areas, listening, hunting, tracking, cooking, ect. Not to mention taking care of the camp and making sure Dutch stays out of trouble. He says he has a plan, but I don't know.

If you want a good cry, max out honour before you complete the main story. I know I was in tears. And I've played through it twice. Same Choices. Every time.

8.5/10 This is simply due to the lack of Rockstar Moderation and Content Updates that they neglected from RDO. I feel Red Dead is much more of a game and world to get lost in than GTA every could.",0.024032258064516122,1752691973,True,1174180

"Almost a great game.
My impression --> The game is quite fun and interesting probably the better of the triage of Wargaming.net games. However, up to level 5 ships can be researched and bought through the players normal grind. At level 6 and above unless you've purchased a DLC that contains a ship above level 5 the game loses its pull for me. Level 6+ ships require Doubloons that never drop and can only be bought. All the fancy ships require currencies that are impossible to acquire without purchasing in-game items. If you don't mind playing below level 6 with the exception of DLC's you will actually enjoy the battles.  Doubloons are the major in-game currency and the caveat being that unless doubloons start dropping the paywall truly separates further progression in play unless you're willing to fork out some serious cash for the really boss ships they offer by buying the in-game currencies.",0.03486842105263157,1752448003,True,552990

However, with the new expansion (I only played for 4 hours before I had to throw in the towel) and I now have so many complaints.
1: All of my past builds are worthless. Thanks to the new armor system my builds that were above par, are now well subpar. I move slower then a snail in molasses. 

2: Theres no new subclass, no new abilities. For an expansion, id expect SOMETHING new to be added. Theres nothing here. Before I get someone to try and defend the game let me breakdown my perspective:
Beyond Light: Stasis
Witch queen: Weapon crafting
Lightfall: Strand
Final Shape: Prismatic
Edge of fate: ???
Theres nothing here. Why am I expected to pay 100$ for a 30$ expansion.

"The current state of the endgame is far too barren, the PvP is horrendously unbalanced and broken, the deep desert is full of people duping items, exploiting bugs, and hacking. The current state of the endgame makes the buildup to it feel like wasted effort.

What's worse is that while the devs claim to be making PvE more available by increasing the area flagged as PvE in the endgame area, the amount of resources has been halved and the respawn timer on those resource nodes has almost doubled from 25 minutes to 45 minutes. 

So an entire server cluster of potentially hundreds of people have to fight over 20 nodes that spawn every 45 minutes and yield so few resources you would need get ALL 20 nodes EVERY respawn for days straight to have enough resources to make both the endgame items and crafting stations needed to make them.

I don't mind PvP but it's more forced than ever, and just as broken and unbalanced as it was at the start, if not moreso.

"In my opinion, Persona 3 marks a turning point in how the Persona games are perceived and developed. I haven’t played the original Persona 3 or any of its later ports to other consoles with improvements, but from the very beginning, I can feel that the game was originally conceived in 2006 (or earlier). It keeps the essence of the original while bringing improved visuals, music, and story, yet it still maintains the vibe of the earlier version.

Personally, Persona 3 has become my favorite game. I love everything about it—its music, story, characters, plot... in short, I like everything. Of course, like any game, it has its weak points, and as I mentioned, I haven’t played the earlier versions of Persona 3, but it seems to me that these issues have existed for a long time. So, why were these problems left unaddressed? Could it be that the developers thought changing these things would drastically alter the game, or do they genuinely see nothing wrong with those decisions?

Either way, I have nothing more to say except this: whether you've played another Persona game or haven’t but enjoy turn-based games, giving this one a try would be a great idea.",0.05462962962962963,1752795484,True,2161700

"夏特入手第一個p系列，100小通關，非常推薦追求帶入感的二次元玩家入手。

角色塑造是我覺得最棒的部分，在一整年的時間裡，幾乎是每天你都會和主角團角色有不同的日常對話，靠著這些大量日常對話，還有各自的支線劇情，再加上主線劇情，塑造出了一個個個性鮮明的角色。

社群部分比較複雜，女角部分是絕對好評的，角色個性都很討喜，並且主角團女角戀愛劇情都超讚，尤其是油咖哩根本我老婆，太可愛了。
但問題就是這社群其實男角居多，而且不少角色個性都比較奇葩，但是在我真的一個個去做完，在結尾的學校看到大家在我的幫助下，走向各自的未來並向我感謝的時候，那種感覺真的非常棒。

戰鬥部分我個人是覺得很棒的，前期有打到弱點的面具召喚動畫跟總攻擊，中後期有神通法大招，都非常帥，再加上超強的音樂，真的很好玩。
爬塔部分，雖然250層塔聽起來很可怕，但其實每個月20層真的還好，一次頂多兩小時就結束了，甚至之後主角解鎖一些更強的面具後都不用一個小時，不至於產生坐牢感，路上的怪全部繞過去，就抓著稀有怪跟boss打就行。

但最大的遺憾還是結尾，我真的很難接受這種意難平結局，尤其又是這種帶入感那麼強的遊戲，真希望可以有皆大歡喜的ge啊，即使是犧牲一點設定上的合理性也好。",0.0,1752790699,True,2161700

The combat takes the tight timing-based parries that I love from Sekiro and blends them with turn-based combat, augmented by a surprisingly robust and flexible build-craft progression system. But let's not bury the lead. The story is the real star of the show here. Even though it's set in a bizarre and unique world the characters are very grounded and relatable (not to mention it is VERY French, which is a bonus for me). The plot has multiple jaw-dropping moments as the nature of the world and events is revealed. The voice acting is top-notch in both English in French and I had a really hard time deciding which language to use (I ended up playing most of it in French). It's all the more incredible when you learn the back story of the team who made it, most of whom were first-timers in the gaming industry. The music is also incredible and I've found myself listening it to on Spotify ever since finishing the game. Bravo, Sandfall.",0.2641904761904762,1752691149,True,1903340

"Великолепная игра. Лучше ли она Dark Souls, Elden Ring, Sekiro, Bloodborne? А вот тут интересно, потому что игра впитала (или спиздила) отовсюду механики и игровые концепции. Однако любителям жанра в обязательном порядке рекомендую. С учётом того, что это лучший Dark Souls не от разработчиков Dark Souls, минусы здесь скорее номинальные.

Начал я с демки на фестивале, и тогда игра мне показалось очень не очень. И так оно и оказалось. Разработчики в будущем очень много чего поменяли. Тогда же игра работала странно - ни уклонения, ни парирования не работали чётко. И игра ощущалась очень скользко. Анимации странные, враги резкие, предпринятые действия не проявляли достаточного отклика.

Спустя год патчей такого больше нет. Правда будьте готовы к тому, что чтобы играть без проблем, придётся привыкать как к парированию, так и к уклонению - которое тут не такое сильное как в серии DS. Тем, кому нравится как Dark Souls, так Sekiro будет легко. Остальным соболезную. Не получится учить и использовать что-то одно. Причём стиль игры зависит от многих факторов, а не только от противников.

Есть вполне себе и самостоятельные оригинальные механики, но их не много. Иными словами, если вас заебала формула Dark Souls - данную игру можете пропускать. Кардинально нового здесь вы не увидите ничего. Из раздражительного хочу отметить совсем унылую и часто ломающую динамику механику починки, душную своим обязательством для определённого момента механику сбора и прослушивания пластинок, совсем дурной и кривой прыжок, механику уклонений, случайные фризы раз в 3 часа и парочку совсем тупорылых боссов. Дополнительно, фрустрацию вызвал ещё квест персонажа Евгении. Он имеет какое-то бредовое условие для получения положительного финала. Лично для меня это единственные существенные минусы, которые я бы не хотел видеть в будущих проектах студии по вселенной Lies of P.

Что касается положительных или около нейтральных моментов, то тут их подавляющее большинство. В игре есть последовательный и очень прямолинейный сюжет. Такое понравится всем. И хоть лично мне присутствие такого сюжета в подобных игра не важно, свой драматизм вносится как ни крути. Довольно большое количество орудий. Под любой стиль игры. С другой стороны есть много мусора и явная слабость тяжёлого оружия относительно быстрого или сбалансированного. Всё компенсируется механикой сборки. Можно изменить как анимации, так и параметры урона, скалирования и свойства того или иного клинка. Классный, но не шедевральный, саундтрек дополняет игру таким образом, что она по атмосфере невероятно сильно напоминает Dark Souls 3 или Elden Ring. Отличный и вполне удобный хаб, система перемещений. В основном, колоритные боссы и противники. Улучшение персонажа кварцем - это очень прикольная механика, которую стоит без фанатизма, но всё же развивать. Прикольные костюмы, а вот шапки в основе своей - это дичь на уровне китайских говномобилок. Есть как прикольные макси, так и абсолютно кринжовое говно. И я надеюсь, что этого фансервиса будет меньше.

В итоге, Lies of P(здюк) - это парадоксально Франкенштейн, слепленный из кусков всех существующих игр From Software, но который ощущается практически так, как будто ты играешь в новый спин-оф серии Dark Souls/Elden Ring. По моему мнению конечно на уровне лора и базиса для развития вселенной она отстаёт и от DS, и от ER, и от BB. Но тем не менее отличий по полученному уровню эмоций и удовлетворённости тупо нет. Dark Souls 3 остаётся для меня лучше, но лишь на капельку. А значит - это успех. Ждём после DLC работу над ошибками, сомнительными моментами и продолжения рассказа об этом мире, где ложь по истинному является и даром, и проклятьем.",-0.15,1752854920,True,1627720

"Leider kann ich es so wie es gerade ist (Stand 07.07.2025) nicht weiter empfehlen.
Mit Season 1 zeigt sich nun leider sehr deutlich das es im Grunde wie jedes andere mobile game ist nur mit einer anderen Verkleidung. Die Mechaniken und der Schwierigkeitsgrad aktuell sind so ausgelegt um ein erreichen des ""End-Games"" nur mit entweder mehreren hundert Stunden Spielzeit oder Geld auszugeben zu erreichen. Der Schwierigkeitsgrad wurde auch nur unnötig nach oben geschoben um das neue Gebiet künstlich in die Länge zu ziehen. Von den Shop Preisen fange ich erst gar nicht an aber ein Kosmetic für 34 Euro und dann nicht mal Account gebunden sondern nur Charakter ist schon sehr unverschämt.

Drei Beispiele:
-Das Broken Sword Artefakt Event
Hier zeigt sich schon mal um was sich die Season 1 dreht. Um ein neues Artefakt und die Mechanik dahinter. Natürlich ist es so integriert um Geld auszugeben wenn du die nötigen Ressourcen nicht hast um die Event Quest abzuschließen. Bekommst du zwei vom BS erhältst du ein drittes gratis. Nur leider wird dass der Großteil nicht erreichen.

-Die neuen Season Worm Walks und Beyond The Wall
Diese bauen natürlich auf das neue Artefakt auf und sind ohne dieses bzw. ohne hohen Momentum (Schwung) / Attack Power nicht machbar. So sind leider die Kosmetics/Belohnungen nur sehr schwer zu erreichen.

-Kraken Raid
Wurde angekündigt mit ""alle"" können mitmachen. Naja, nur wenn du 130K Schwung hast, und selbst dann ist es nicht leicht machbar da er zu schwierig ist und auch etwas buggy. Abgesehen davon es als Raid zu bezeichnen ist auch sinnfrei, da es sich eigentlich um eine 4er Dungeon handelt mit 5 Mechaniken.

Den Discord kannst du auch vergessen da hier niemand der berechtigte Kritik ausübt für voll genommen wird.
Cringe Discord trifft es da schon recht gut.

Ich persönlich werde jetzt noch Season 1 mitmachen und abwarten was sich noch ändern wird. Da aber Stand heute auch das Creator Programm ""vorerst"" auf Eis gelegt wurde und bis dato die Roadmap nicht veröffentlicht wurde, sehe ich keine gute Zukunft für das Spiel.

Новые биомы пустые, в них нет контента, каждый новый биом имеет несколько минусов и ноль плюсов, играть в них можно только ради челленджа или рп. 

Новые локации\точки интереса, точно также пустые, лута нет, нового контента нет, просто десятки километров одинаковых, шаблонных, ПУСТЫХ руин. 

Новые квесты умышленно спавнятся где-то оооочень далеко от базы, из-за чего без корабля их просто нереально выполнять, но ты не можешь поставить корабль на базе большую часть игры, потому что нужен дорогущий гравиякорь чтобы база не потерялась навсегда.

Сама возможность путешествий открывается настолько поздно, что в этом просто нет смысла, зачем строить корабль для путешествий если за эти же ресурсы в это время можно построить корабль для концовки? 

Отдельно хочу выделить жизнь на два поселения (основная база и корабль на ней) Менеджмент корабля превращается в АД где невозможно нормально настроить склады, столовую, электрику. 

Ещё не дошёл до концовки, но случайно заспойлерил себе, она в целом на таком же уровне.

Во всём длс есть только два светлых момента:
1. Возможность построить собственный шатл для путешествий.
2. Действительно уникальная генерация карт в сочетании с особенностями может создать хорошую клетку для базы.

"—「拠点ゲーム」の概念が変わる、もうひとつのRimWorld。

RimWorldというゲームは、たいてい「拠点をつくって守るゲーム」として知られています。ですが、新DLC『Odyssey』は、その常識を根本から覆します。

このDLCで最も驚かされたのは、「マップに縛られない」という自由さ。
たったこれだけで、プレイ体験がまるごと変わります。

これまでのDLCが「拠点を強化するための追加要素」だったのに対し、Odysseyはゲームそのものの構造に手を入れてきた。拠点を一つの場所に固定する必要がなくなったことで、プレイのテンポが自然と変わり、「移動する」「適応する」「探検する」といった新たな行動が中心になります。

そして、それを支えるのが膨大に増えた動植物とバイオームの数。
行く先々で未知の環境と出会い、適応しながら生き延びていく感覚は、まるで別のゲームを遊んでいるよう。

特にすごいのは、「中盤から終盤のだれ」を感じさせないこと。
通常のRimWorldでは、拠点が安定すると一気に緊張感が薄れ、惰性でのプレイになりがちでした。ですが、Odysseyではその“安定”すら一時的で、常に新たな環境と課題が待ち受けています。
「このままここに留まっていていいのか？」「次はどこへ向かう？」と、自分自身に問いながら進んでいく感覚は、どこか旅をしているようでもあります。

結果として、飽きが来ない。
むしろ「次はどんな世界が待っているんだろう」とワクワクが止まらず、
何度も“もう1マップだけ…”と時間が溶けていきます。

⸻

RimWorldを「まだやっていない人」だけでなく、
「もう一通り遊んだ」という人にも、ぜひ体験してほしいDLCです。

RimWorldという宇宙の中に、もうひとつの広大な宇宙が開かれました。
それがOdysseyです。

"The game is nearly a masterpiece imo. Katherine's brooch and necklace at the end of the siege truly sum up how well-thought-out every detail of the game is.

There are two downsides for me: the rapid advancement in thievery and because of that you can get rich very quickly. The other is that some of the things we do in the game have no impact on the story. For example, during the siege, when Samuel and I went to raid the camp for help, I killed all the soldiers. Options like returning to the castle and calling my friends to loot or burning the camp down would have been really nice. Even if that wasn't a scenario in dev's mind, I shouldn't have been given the power to kill all the soldiers.

My absolute favorite parts of the game are the sword fighting, feeling the world come alive and the fact that people whose keys stolen change their locks after 2-3 days are all excellent details. The siege was definitely the best medieval experience I've ever had in a game. The servants crying during the siege and getting into a fistfight with someone so he wouldn't eat my dog were really great details.",0.11560846560846562,1752691527,True,1771300

Satisfactory is like crack for anyone who thinks efficiency is sexy. One minute you're placing a miner, next thing you know it's 3 AM, you're debugging a power grid, and you're whispering sweet nothings to your perfectly aligned belts.

It's chaotic, it's brilliant, and it's weirdly peaceful. I’ve never been so emotionally attached to a bunch of machines before. This game broke my brain—and then rebuilt it with reinforced iron plates.

"I've been playing the game since last year, few months last year and a few now. I had ESO Plus, because it is really tiring and a gatekeeper to other stuff in the game if you don't have it.

I was most focused in PvE content, solo content. To people who likes to stay in the story side in a RPG, it is a great game, you can solo content easily, even if you're not strong, and that was my case because since the beggining I had a tank char, so I couldn't do considerable damage. But to enjoy everything plus is necessary, of course.

But is a OLD GAME, and the main problem of old online games to me is the players who ""live for the game"", who take it like the most important thing in theirs lives, and make a hell in your life if you're not in the level, the class, the abilities, they want to. It's a TERRIBLE game with a TOXIC community when it comes to online content.

ESO, like other games that have online content with roles, have sooooo few players playing tank and healer. You can wait minutes to hour in a line to play a online content.

And I chosed to be a tank because of that, to join my friends in some contents (dungeons).

And being a tank or a healer IN A WAY that the toxic players like, it's so demanding, and frustrating, THEY DO NOT have patience if you're a new player.

I decided to stop playing the game, because i tried my best, i waited to be in a mid-higher level, +500CP, and have a FULL BUILD, that took me months to farm, so I could be useful and don't receive a bad treatment. But with few trials (12 people content), the toxic players ended all my joy to play this game. I was new to trials, I did a mistake in one, because i did not know the mechanics, and I reicived messages calling me names, threating me, telling me to end my life, in the wort ways possible.

A lot of players in this game are bad with new players, and treat them like trash just because they don't know something. WHAT DON'T MAKE SENSE, because if you're new, u will not know.

And the worse to me, ibeing a game YOU PAY, because without pass it's frustrating to play this game, so it's a MMORPG you pay monthy, the ZeniMax don't take actions to solve the toxicity of the comunity. I'm telling my case here, but all my friends suffered the same in some point with online content.

So, if you want to play this game, be aware people there are becoming more and more toxic.

"The longevity and success of 7 Days to Die can be largely attributed to its modability and strong community engagement. One of the game’s greatest strengths has always been its sandbox survival experience, where players are given the freedom to adapt and build anywhere. However, recent updates introducing ""badges"" or restrictions on building near trader areas represent a shift away from that core survival ethos. While perhaps intended to balance gameplay or encourage exploration, they can feel limiting—especially for players who enjoy establishing bases near traders as part of their strategic planning. The freedom to build and survive on one's own terms is a hallmark of the experience that should be preserved.

Moreover, it's evident that the modding community consistently produces innovative and high-quality content, often at a faster pace than official development cycles. From overhaul mods like Darkness Falls and Undead Legacy to minor quality-of-life tweaks, these community contributions have filled gaps and kept the game fresh for years. Integrating official support for the Steam Workshop would be a major step forward, empowering creators and making it easier for players to discover and install mods seamlessly. It’s a feature many players have requested, and its addition would elevate the game’s accessibility and replay value.

While recent updates have introduced small but welcome quality-of-life improvements, such as UI tweaks, smoother animations, and stability fixes, some of these changes feel incremental. Players who have followed the game’s long development cycle may feel that more substantial content additions are overdue.

That said, the developers have done commendable work over the years expanding the game. From a content perspective, 7 Days to Die has evolved dramatically—from its early alpha builds to its current state. The inclusion of new POIs (Points of Interest), biomes, complex zombie AI, electricity systems, and the addition of dynamic weather and water systems have made the world feel more immersive and challenging. Continued improvements to weapon variety, armor customization, and vehicle mechanics have also added depth to combat and mobility.

Going forward, many in the community would love to see:

Expanded weapon and armor systems with modular upgrades and unique effects

More diverse vehicle options with customization capabilities

Base-building improvements including new block shapes, defensive traps, and AI behavior

Official modding tools and Steam Workshop support for streamlined access

Optional toggles to preserve the open-ended survival feel for solo and private servers

In conclusion, 7 Days to Die remains one of the most versatile and replayable survival games available today. By embracing its modding roots and refining both player freedom and official content updates, the game has the potential to reach true top-tier status in its genre.",0.1756988578797089,1752814127,True,251570

Задумался феодал и понял, что нужно возводить города на новых участках, там и земли и руды прекрасны. Все шло у него, как по маслу. В городе овцы и разнообразие пищи, в корчме крестьяне бурно радовались элю. И вот через время возвел поселения на местах иноземных и решил между ними бартер устроить.

Başta geçici bir sunucu hatası sandım, ama aynı anda e-mailime bir bildirim düştü. Blizzard’dan gelen mailde Battle.net hesabımın süresiz olarak banlandığı yazıyordu.

Şaka gibi. Ulan daha 20 saatim var oyunda, ne hilesi? Bot desen yok, glitch abuse desen o da yok. Sktir boktan ToS’lerinden dolayı ban sebebini de açıklamıyorlar. “Topluluk kuralları ihlali” deyip geçiyorlar. (Skimi emin oeları.) Hesabı kapatıyorlar ama nedenini bildirme gereği duymuyorlar.

Maili görmemle birlikte Blizzard desteğine ticket attım. Türkçe destek zaten yok, destek sayfasındaki yazılar bile Google Translate ile çevrilmiş gibi. Tamam, İngilizce ticket atmak sorun değil, onu geçtim. Ama gel gelelim, ticket’ıma hala cevap veren yok. En kötü bir otomatik dönüş olur, incelemede dersin, bir şey dersin.

Eğer bu kadar bahtsızsanız ve aynı zamanda benim kadar sabırsızsanız şunu bilin: GM’lerin gooning challenge yaptığı için günlerce cevap alamazsınız. Oyunun parasını verirken iyiler, ama iş desteğe geldi mi ortada yoklar.

Uğraşmayın. Oyunu silin, Blizzard’a her yerden sövün. Tek yapabildiğim bu oldu zaten.

"[h1]I Thought It Would Be Better[/h1]

I tried to like this game. I really did. But after nearly 55 hours, it’s still deeply disappointing.

[h2]Made in USA and From Mother Russia with Love[/h2]

 1.No, this isn’t a joke or a jab. The whole game feels like a Russia vs. USA are trying to relive their Cold War era. Why even set it in Europe if all we get are a few AI-controlled Latvian, Lithuanian, and Estonian units, and every Leopard 2 is crewed by Americans?

I came in expecting a CIS vs NATO scenario. Instead, I got Russia vs USA in the Baltics for some reason. Even the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 campaign made more geopolitical sense. Where are the European forces? Apparently, Russia threatened nukes if Europe steps in. [spoiler]Let’s ignore the fact that France doesn’t have a no-first-use policy, meaning they’d probably launch a tactical nuke at Russia as a “warning shot.”[/spoiler] So we’re just shredding Article 5 now? Cool.

I get the need for balance, so I won’t even touch the fact that the T-14 Armata is portrayed as a real battle tank, or that the RAH-66 Comanche randomly shows up like it’s just supposed to be here, with all It’s might and glory of 2 prototypes.

A genuine positive: Nothing boosts my serotonin quite like hearing a Russian unit yell “Parada moy!” (Googled it. Might be wrong. Still love it.)

[h2]It’s a Multiplayer Experience, All Right[/h2]

1.If you get lucky with a competent team—and an equally competent enemy—it can be fun. Sadly, those matches are rarer than a solar eclipse.

2.Splitting CIS from the rest of the world could work… until a Russian player joins, types in Cyrillic, and my Slavic brother in Christ, I’m sorry—I can’t read Russian. That is, if he doesn’t disconnect or get booted by the servers. Honestly, who knows anymore.

3.Speaking of disconnects: if you haven’t been randomly booted yet, count your blessings. Let me paint a picture:
3.1: You get disconnected mid-match.
3.2: Try to reconnect—nope.
3.3: Restart the game—still nope.
3.4: Restart Steam—nope again.
3.5: Restart your PC—congrats! You’ve now “deserted” the match hope those 20 minutes of playing were worth it.

4.Now imagine this:
4.1: You’re in a 5v5.
4.2: Two teammates rage-quit, because, their attack failed.
4.3: You’re left juggling their units while trying to hold the front.
4.4: They don’t return, so they’re marked as deserters.
4.5: No AI fill-ins. No surrender vote. No mechanics to try and balance the game.
4.6: You’re stuck in a lopsided match, wasting your time.

Want a fairer experience? Go play Wargame: Red Dragon 2.

5.Cheaters? Of course. Server crashes? Frequent. Quick fixes for leavers? Nonexistent. Surrender option? Still waiting.

[h3]48,99€[/h3]

For this price, I could buy Wargame: Red Dragon 2 with all expansions and still have money left for snacks.

Charging nearly €50 for a game with this many issues is laughable. I didn’t want to write this review—I hoped for updates and fixes. But it’s reached a point where I just don’t care anymore.

Overall: Wait for major patches or a deep sale. Right now, this game is not worth €50.",0.012843073593073595,1752691331,False,1604270

From feeding on enemies to building your gothic castle. Combat is fluid and fun, the world feels alive, and the progression is super satisfying. Whether you're playing solo or with friends, there's always something to do and explore. Highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys survival games with a dark twist. Easily one of my favorite games this year.

su incursion toma fuerte inspiracion filosofica y tomando una atmosfera que te hace sentir que si no ganas esto, es el fin de todo.... Una raid muy inmersiva y un contenido fuera de raid bastante fresco y divertido, lo recomiendo mucho.

"Primero que nada, el juego no es del todo malo, tiene muchas cosas increíbles y muchísimo contenido ademas que desafíos interesantes y demandantes. Los DLC's son muy llamativos y dan horas de contenido que mucho es de calidad, ademas que al comprarlos no se sienten como pay to win (de hecho en el contenido gratuito se consiguen mejores cosas) simplemente amplían tu arsenal llenándolo de posibilidades. 

Con este juego he pasado horas increíbles, tanto en solitario contemplando los paisajes como en con mis amigos completando actividades y mejorando el armamento ¿Pero entonces por que no lo puedo recomendar?

Pese a lo bueno que es, el juego es horrible para nuevos jugadores, tiene una trama e historia fascinante y entrañable, pero el hecho de que no este completa y no se pueda jugar de ningún modo coherente simplemente hace que te sientas desubicado y con muchas dudas con el juego. Muchos de los personajes tiene buena escritura pero están entrelazados a eventos pasados que ya no se pueden jugar, entendiendo el porque están ahí pero sin transmitir emoción que muchos veteranos si tuvieron haciendo una experiencia poco homogénea en la comunidad. 

Ademas de las actividades gratuitas y de ""early game"" el juego tiene una curva de dificultad muy retadora, obligándote a jugar con amigos o aprendiendo mucho meta y mecánicas. El tutorial no sirve como introducción ni de dichas mecánicas (muestra lo básico pero no te dice nada de las stats) ni tampoco te da contexto suficiente de la historia. 

Al forzar a otros a pagar por actividades a sobreprecio y a entrar a una historia muy desconectada hace que sea difícil convencer a otros jugadores y enseñarles a jugar este juego. Ademas últimamente las decisiones de Bungie son cada vez más cuestionables en su dirección y el hecho de que se borra contenido sin la posibilidad de re jugarlo hace que te plantees 2 veces si realmente vale la pena en invertir en el.

"Хорошая игра жанра Medieval Total War, но с вовлечение в виде возможности принимать участие в битве непосредственно. 
Но кучей недоработанных механик на которые положили болт. Закрыли основные - игра была бы шедевральна. 
Плюсы:
  1. Это игра аля Medieval Total War. Зарубы сотен мужики(и не только) в форме. Кони, стрелы, камни с неба, Вьетнам. 
  2. Одевайте/раздевайте своего перса и подчинённых как душе угодно, доспехов много+ моды. Тяжесть брони имеет как плюсы так и минусы. Как и длина оружия. 
  3. Тактика и торговля. Бегайте, договаривайтесь, торгуйте, нападайте, выполняйте задания. 
  4. Прокачка персонажа. 
  5. В бою можно самому бегать и махать огромным топором, но не просто, а правильно фехтовать. 
  6. Возможность создать собственное королевство и захватить мир. 
Минусы. 
Минусов тоже много, но в основном они связаны с недоделанными механиками. 
  1. Командовать в бою можно, но войска тебя плохо слушают + если ты в пылу схватки нельзя отдалить камеру и дать ряд приказов, к примеру, коннице. 
Хотите чтобы конница промчалась сквозь строй лучников? Извольте родить слона. Банальное ""в атаку"" на строй  - кони побегут в рассыпную до ближайших противников. 
  2. Нельзя отдавать команды катапультам ни при осаде ни при штурме. А стреляют они, по принципу на какой бок хер лёг. Разве что при штурме можешь сам за нее сесть. 
  3. Дипломатия. Считай в лейт гейме её нет, а точнее она максимально проста. Можно индивидуально повышать доверие персонажей. Но как только ты стал королевством, как-то договориться, объявить совместную войну, просто нормально платить дань без необходимости регулярных заруб - нет.
  4. Спутники ничего не говоря просто сваливают в закат если им что-то не нравится. 

Итог. Игра очень сильно затягивает. Хоть и приходится постоянно бороться с кривыми механиками. И в лейте веьма разочаровывает.

"Assassin’s Creed Origins – A Breathtaking Return to the Beginning
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5)

Assassin’s Creed Origins marks a bold and refreshing reinvention of the long-running franchise, taking players back to ancient Egypt during the rise of the Brotherhood. As both a historical epic and a character-driven journey, Origins excels on multiple levels.

You play as Bayek of Siwa, a Medjay whose personal tragedy sets him on a path of vengeance, justice, and ultimately, transformation. His character is compelling, emotionally layered, and well-voiced, making him one of the most memorable protagonists in the series.

Visually, Origins is stunning. From the golden sands of the desert to the bustling streets of Alexandria, Ubisoft's recreation of Ptolemaic Egypt is immersive and awe-inspiring. Every ruin, statue, and hieroglyph feels authentic, inviting exploration and rewarding curiosity. The day-night cycle and dynamic weather further enhance the realism and beauty of the world.

Gameplay-wise, Origins introduces an overhauled combat system, trading in the old ""counter-attack"" mechanics for a more fluid and challenging action-RPG approach. It may take some getting used to, but the change adds depth and satisfaction to every encounter. The inclusion of loot, gear upgrades, and skill trees adds customization and strategy that was lacking in previous entries.

The story is rich with political intrigue, emotional moments, and mythology, all while setting the foundation for the Assassin Brotherhood. The side quests are meaningful and diverse, often telling unique stories that deepen the world and its characters.

The game also features the incredible Discovery Tour mode, which lets you explore ancient Egypt as a living museum—an excellent educational tool and a peaceful, beautiful way to appreciate the game’s artistry and research.

Verdict:
Assassin’s Creed Origins is more than just a return to form—it's a rebirth. With its captivating world, emotionally grounded protagonist, and engaging gameplay, it not only revitalizes the franchise but sets a new standard for historical open-world games. A must-play for fans of the series and newcomers alike.",0.24895622895622893,1752688959,True,582160

"This game is fun, is it worth 40$ I wouldn't say so. A lot of it is the same, new enemies sure, and a few new toys but the same skills, performance problems, etc. Thankful since the game is so short (half or less than the first game) you start with each ability (2 levels in each skill at the start). I get it's a ""DLC"" but personally get on discount, still fun tho.

The finishers are very limited, there's only like 5 types and whenever you do one it cuts to a cut-scene of it being performed, but they get old quick, sometimes you don't even get a change to use them in areas they're in because how far they are from enemies, especially on harder difficulties.

The new weapons are very fun, and you get to use the bigger more exciting weapons more often huge plus, [spoiler] your auto-9 also gets a awesome new board near the end that just demolishes everything. [/spoiler] I feel like they added many hub areas to the game, but they server no purpose then to talk to a few npcs from before. Personally I feel like they should've had more to-do for these areas, It's definitely a far more linear then the first. Another rant is the difficulty hard and extreme they aren't, different Dev's definitely worked on different areas, sometimes there's healing items between each room, and other area's they're few and far between. 

The ending is anti-climatic, the final mission is just a few small objectives, then a run to get to the top and catch the big bad. They hype up this big drone robot, so bad you don't want to run into it ever but... [spoiler] There is no drone boss, its a few rooms with it flying around the tower shooting at you while some grunt waves bother you, but since the drone is so strong (basically and ED that flies) it just kills the enemies for you, no joke half the time its not shooting you but the other grunts. You end up just disabling it and it crashes and that it, no fight not really dodging it or anything, just kinda mozing on the final floor. [/spoiler] Finally you reach the big bad and... [spoiler] A cut-scene plays RoboCop is so cool he stops his escape, oh boy maybe there's another drone, or he has some ""Macguffin"" or something but no he gets up they talk for a moment and you have some slow mo event where you have to shoot him, he dies the end roll credits, no post story, no what happened after, just credits, back to main menu.[/spoiler] The final few missions felt rushed development, I'm sure they had ideas to add a boss, etc. but it falls flat at the end.

There is no new game plus, although I personally didn't have a reason to do a new game plus, just a downside compared to the first game. I do think if there's no new game plus, I should be able to max out every skill, maybe you could but i couldn't.

The achievements are just like the first game, a few you get from exploring but generally you're getting most of them just playing the game, I feel the Dev's could add a few that are more difficult. I had one bugged achievement [spoiler] Part Man, Part Machine, All Correct [/spoiler] I did this achievement many times but it just didn't proc.

Performance is a huge issue, for a game like this, it really shouldn't struggle at all, I played through it but having to use dlss just to get 20fps in some areas is really bad optimization. I feel many places was just poorly optimized. Sometimes I get somewhere before the game could load, when this happens I can see outside the map, and see many things just loading outside that you can't see and shouldn't be loaded, Spinning in a circle drops frames heavy, many times looking in certain directions just shits on performance, if you destroy too much details in a area it drop performance heavy too. this has been an issue since the first game. thinking they spent time on this ""DLC"" they could look into optimizations and engine upgrades, plug some memory leaks, etc. The guns even have unnecessary details modeled, that you wouldn't see during normal game-play. [spoiler] It really sucks when they added a new enemy, a robot drone that are basically moving landmines, they chase you after sometimes if you don't destroy them. The issue is when the game starts chugging and you can't aim properly because of the performance issues they explode on death, not only that if they're more then one in a room, you shoot one others around it activate, and start honing in on your location. I've died a few times because my games starts chugging and I can't aim at them properly. [/spoiler] This is on a 4th gen m.2,  4060ti, 32gb of ram, Ryzen 5 5600x, and it chugs still with dlss with frame generation, crazy. 

Any-who I had fun playing it, I loved the first game with all it's downsides with performance, this game would be a a lot, I mean a lot better if the performance issues were fixed. I would recommend it if they did.

"[h1]🛑 DEAD OR ALIVE - YOU ARE CRASHING WITH ME! 🛑[/h1]

As previous title, it's Robocop in and out.
Sure they went a bit stylistic about the environmental design being more of Futuristic Brutalism, Concrete, steel, and hard angular forms. Less of neighborhoods, factories etc etc, pretty sure you can see the screenshots from the game.
That might make the game feel more strict in terms of where to go what to do unlike previous game, which let you roam around a whole block and go to different environments, salvage yard, police station, prison, THE f***ing OCP TOWER.

However if you are expecting the same levels of environmental changes, you will be wanting for more.

Environmental rant is over, now about the game itself:

[u][b]✅ THE Good:[/b][/u]
[b]🔹 Robocop[/b]

[b]🔹 Shooting holds up.[/b] Same as the last game. Punchy, loud, bodies react like being hit with a train.
Doesn’t reinvent anything, but it doesn’t need to.

[b]🔹 Environmental storytelling is solid.[/b] You get bits and pieces from the RoboCop universe scattered naturally. A lot is reused from the previous game, but it's placed well and doesn’t feel lazy.

[b]🔹 Performance is fine.[/b] On a 9800X3D with a 3070 Ti, I’m getting 90–100 FPS on Epic with DLSS on Quality. No AMD Framegen toggle sadly, but the game runs smooth on my end. (Samsung 990 Pro, 32gb Ram - 6000)

[b]🔹 Voice Acting & Sound Design.[/b] Peter Weller’s return still carries weight. His lines have that classic cold delivery, and the audio mix in general makes it feel great and authentic.

[b]🔹 Side gigs break up the action decently.[/b] Some police work, some crowd control, adds just enough variety between the corridor shootouts.

[u][b]❌ The BAD:[/b][/u]
[b]⚠️ As a narrative expansion (standalone DLC),[/b] it plays too safe. The structure and pacing closely mirror the original game, without offering much evolution in gameplay or mission variety. It's the previous game but you are dropped in Judge Dredd Mega Tower. Big building overrun by baddies, and you are cleaning the house. Go figure.

[b]⚠️ Level design is overly familiar.[/b] You will be going through a lot of tunnels, doing a lot of door breaches with 3 second slow-mo just to kill a couple of dudes behind the door, a large portion is reused content with minor edits, which limits the sense of exploration or surprise.

[b]🤖 Enemy AI[/b]
This is a big one, and quite important one.
Most enemies follow the same basic script: spot Robocop, shout something like ""HEY IT'S THE COP!"" then sprint directly into gunfire in which the only outcome is being shot in the balls. There's no sense of fear, flanking, or survival instinct.
They rarely take cover or reposition. Even when cover is available, enemies often stand in the open or awkwardly walk into line of sight, making firefights feel like shooting range.

Imagine you're just some thug with a floppy AK or worse, a 9mm SMG. And suddenly, a solid block of titanium with a gun bigger and harder than anything you've had in the morning kicks down your door. What do you do? These guys walk straight into it and die like it's their sole purpose in life. At this point pain them silver and give them all a voiceline ""WITNESS MEE!!!""

[b]TLDR:[/b] Combat loses its edge fast. Once you realize the enemy will never outsmart you, encounters become routine. Even high-damage enemies don’t feel dangerous, they're just damage sponges with no awareness.

[b]🔫 Auto-9 (Robocop Gun)[/b]
The Auto-9 is too strong for what the game throws at you. One-shot kills, even on heavily armored enemies, paired with infinite ammo and oversized mags, strip any need for strategy or weapon variety. I understand Robocop was lethal in the films, but he was gunning down thugs, not full body armored mercs.
Here, you’re pistol whipping literal military tier enemies like they’re made of paper. If you're going to stretch realism, give us his machine gun arm from Robocop 3 or something. And the option to pick up enemy weapons just feels wrong, Robocop never did that. It breaks character and cheapens the fantasy.

[b]P.S.[/b] The only time RoboCop used another weapon in the films was the Cobra Assault Cannon in the first movie, and that was a one-time, story-driven moment. He didn’t loot it off a thug mid-fight lol.

[b]💥 The crashes.[/b]
It's not much to say, the game crashes. And i am not the only one, again major slip up on behalf of QA team, if they have a QA team at Teyon even.
However just play the game for 1-2 hours at once and you are guaranteed to have a crash, no matter what you do.
Could it be my 8 gb of VRAM? I don't know. Nvidia Drivers? Unreal Engine 5? Biggest nature's mystery.
It's playable and not very infuriating considering auto-save exists.
Also I played on the release, so I am sure they will iron it out soon with fixes and patches.",0.0032938203771537087,1752878615,True,3527760

AoE IV brings back classic RTS gameplay with a modern touch. Unique civs, historical campaigns, and solid mechanics make it a great experience for both veterans and newcomers.

👍 What’s Great:

Distinct civilizations with unique mechanics

High-quality campaigns with docu-style storytelling

Polished tutorials and accessible design

Lots of replayability and strategic depth

👎 Needs Work:

Some missing features (scenario editor, deeper hotkey options)

Pathfinding and AI can still be clunky

Visuals feel a bit dated; limited camera zoom

Verdict:
A solid revival that nails the basics and offers hours of fun. It’s not perfect, but it’s definitely worth your time—especially if you love strategy.

"Ark will be Ark; all games have issues and unfortunately Ark - and this applies to both Survival Evolved and Survival Ascended - has been plagued with optimization issues and the near-guaranteed issues after any major update. That is not something I believe anyone is denying. However you can't take all the possible issues and compare them to your experience. Mine has been pretty light in terms of issues or bugs encountered, and definitely within reason for any game I would play (and at the time of this writing, the game is still within Early Access.)

Ark has held a special place in my list of games ever since it's initial release while I was on a shoddy laptop. I would recommend this game to anybody who enjoys Survival games. It's spin on the genre - and the inclusion of Big Reptile - make it an experience even if you play casually. I would recommend any new players hold off on any Flying mounts until they really explore the map, it's gorgeous and such a different experience on the ground than the detached feel you eventually get flying over the map. A gorgeous flight, but you tend to get into that Autopilot of just going from A to B. Walk around, die to Raptors a couple hundred times, live the Ark experience.

For fans of Evolved, Ascended has taken Evolved and made it gorgeous, The enhancements to the UI and certain QoL features make this game an amazing remaster. The integrated modding system is far easier than the previous methods for solo play and managing a Server. There is more of a monetary system for certain mods, but the Free original DLC was a great choice and all the better that they reintroduce new DLC and Content that you can buy to enhance your experience for those who want more than a basic remaster. Whether you're looking for an experience solo, or with friends, there's so much this game has to offer, I find all these arguments of ""Pay-to-win"" are null. It doesn't detract from the base experience unless you're looking to hop into Official. At which point Ark has the same experience you'd associate with Rust servers in terms of the tribes you will likely meet. , maybe catch it on the next Sale and if it's not for you - so be it.",0.0933869425148495,1752879515,True,2399830

"It's been a long journey, but Victoria 3 has finally arrived at its destination: truly worth playing! After years of admittedly rough patches and DLCs that felt more like bandaids, the latest expansion has utterly transformed the game.
For a long time, Victoria 3 felt like a promise unfulfilled. The core concept was there, but the execution often left me wanting more. The economy could be opaque, diplomacy felt shallow, and the overall experience often lacked the dynamic depth we expect from a Paradox grand strategy title.
But with this new DLC, it's like a different game entirely. The revamped trade system, the genuinely impactful diplomatic options, and the depth added to various internal mechanics have breathed new life into the Victorian era. I'm no longer just staring at menus; I'm actively engaging with a vibrant, complex world where my decisions truly matter.
This isn't just a small improvement; it's a monumental leap forward. If you, like me, were initially disappointed and set Victoria 3 aside, now is the time to come back. The developers have clearly listened to feedback, and their dedication has paid off. Victoria 3 is finally the grand strategy masterpiece it was always meant to be. Bravo, Paradox! You've earned this positive review.

VOID wanted to earn some extra Dollars and released the game on Console and in order to do so Censored the entire game and downgraded Visual quality and Lighting to fit said Console Cross-play. This Results in a watered down experience from what it used to be.

"I came across a TikTok creator who’s been reviewing adult-themed games for over 10 years. He mentioned that many of the titles on Steam are either censored, incomplete, or have been taken down entirely.

He shared a method for accessing the full, uncensored versions — but due to platform limitations, I can’t share it directly here.

So I encoded the instructions using a harmless Chinese tool. If you're curious, just follow these steps:

1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Search for the Chinese term: “兽音译者” (copy and paste it).
3. Click on the first result.
4. Paste the message below into the input box to decode it.
5. Use Google Translate if needed — the site is in Chinese, but it’s simple to use.

"I was surprised by how much I liked this game. I thought it would be humdrum based on the half-way greyscale color scheme, but it caught me right up. Classes, levels, tactical combat, choices matter (sometimes, but not really that much), professions, missions, some open-world feeling, different paths...it all kind of worked out for a while. It is a surprisingly-well-balanced game.

Graphics are a bit underdeveloped, but it might be for ambience. Music is very upbeat-dark-ages. Combat is between simple and complex depending on your party and load-out, and makes sense. The world is well-designed.  

To date, (52 hours of play time) the only glitch I've found is a character which has twice escaped me and been re-captured, then turned in to a jail, is still in my encampment and can be assigned to a position, but from which I seem to gain nothing. After 52 hours of play with only one glitch is something I can forgive.

"Thumbs Sideways — Great Tech, Underwhelming Gameplay Loop

There’s a lot to like about Shapez 2 on the surface. The factory structures are visually interesting and suggest a promising future. The graphics are clean and modern, the interface is intuitive and slick, and I didn’t encounter a single bug during my playthrough — which is no small feat for an early release.

However, the core gameplay loop left me wanting more.

The constraints system — which could have added challenge and creativity — barely factored into my experience. I never came close to hitting the structure limits, so it didn’t really influence my designs. Side quests start off engaging but quickly become repetitive and feel disconnected from the rest of the game. Once you’ve completed the factory for a quest, it has no ongoing purpose, making it feel like a one-and-done effort with little payoff. The operator badge path alone provided more than enough science to complete progression, making side quests largely irrelevant past the early game.

Unlike Factorio, where your early builds continue to support and evolve into your later infrastructure, Shapez 2 factories feel isolated and disposable. Each one solves a narrow problem, then gets ignored. There’s no sense of a growing, interconnected machine.

The shape mechanics, while initially novel, lack depth. I’d love to see a system where advanced shapes are constructed from simpler ones — a hierarchy where you’re constantly building up from base components. Imagine only starting with quarter circles and squares and needing to combine and split them to reach complex forms — similar to the color mixing system, which is far more satisfying in comparison.

Lastly, it would be a huge improvement if producing shapes was actually necessary to build new structures. That would tie your creations directly to progression and give a real sense of purpose to what you’re building.

Bottom Line: Shapez 2 has excellent production values and real potential, but the current gameplay loop feels shallow. Here’s hoping future updates bring more depth and interconnectedness to match the polish.Thumbs Sideways — Great Tech, Underwhelming Gameplay Loop

"Kenshi can oddly be summarized as Morrowind, if you removed all of the quests from the game, replaced every cliff racer with daedric enemies, and then add in awful performance that cause constant loading screens from running around the map alongside bugs and other issues that will delete half of your base, get your characters killed or even remove them entirely, break your saves outright and sometimes just crash your game when trying to load a save. It's unfortunately a deceptively shallow game that is held together with rubber bands. 

There is a lot going on in the World of Kenshi according to dialogue from its inhabitants, but in reality its all barren and artificial. There are several different factions that have their own issues and conflicts but they are all confined to their own little bubbles and will never reach out beyond them unless you force them too, which just results in a few different npcs spawning in different areas. You can run around and explore the handful of towns spread out across this very large, dead world, and all you'll find are npcs that are flagged to fight other npcs and a few unique characters with barely a paragraphs worth of dialogue. You can interact with all of these happenings by getting beat up by bandits, or trading items that can't be used by npcs to merchants who, in the non existent economy, restock their wallet and inventory every day, or sneak around and steal from said merchants, and that's really it. There are copy and pasted ruins to find with items tailored for the tech tree research and junk that can't be used for anything other than selling, but otherwise nothing interesting to find. No underground arenas to participate in, no local attractions to sight see, no gathering of nobility to make fun of the poor, nor any grand cathedrals with altars for the pious to grovel beneath. Just more desert and more towns filled nearly identical shops and inns.

Engaging with these few activities Kenshi has to offer isn't that meaningful either. The game functions mostly like an RTS so everything plays itself with the only real input from the player being minor positioning and kiting which isn't even that necessary. This creates a very boring gameplay loop that overstays its welcome due to the slow and one dimensional ways to level up your characters. Leveling up any of your characters major skills in combat, crafting, etc. will take dozens of hours if you don't explicitly focus on grinding them and have other priorities than just fighting the locals, or crafting the same cheap gear while you sit on your phone or fight the games performance issues trying to do other in game tasks. You could circumvent the grind by amassing a large number of people, but then comes the issue of annoying micromanaging of inventories, hunger and combing over everyone to check their health. Really the only thing left is the base building side of the game, but that highlights the abysmal ai pathfinding with characters getting stuck on rocks, phasing through walls and getting stuck, or just not doing anything because a small box in the back corner of the room is blocking them from entering the building at all, or the rudimentary job system causing logistical standstills with your workers just not doing things sometimes.

There is charm in its ideas and passion behind its creation, but Kenshi, devoid of the abstract, is just a mechanical and technical mess that feels like its wasting your time by pretending its ambition and scope are reality while gating the meaningful and interesting content with a tedious grind that prevent's you from fully experiencing the world presented and hiding most of it in nooks and crevices that blend in with identical ruins and lifeless structures.",-0.03795961422543703,1752877274,False,233860

"I have been playing since the Beta version many years ago. I enjoyed the development and limited thinking required after a hard day's work.  But recently, especially with the Beacon update, there is a strong push towards Pantheistic religion that I do not appreciate and take a lot of offence to. At least once every 5 to 10 ""Overseer decisions"" is based on having to ""pray"" to some natural ""god"" of wind or water. If you want to be a Pantheist, that is your God given right to make that choice, but to do not force it down your players' throats.

If the developers persist in pushing their Pantheistic agenda down players' throats they should lose many players; personally I will not longer subject myself to these so called ""decisions"". You may argue it is just a game, but we all know games has become much more than just games with the level of interaction and emotion it can evoke in us.

There is only one true God, and that is the great I AM, the Creator of the real world we live in.

"First off, I sadly didn't play the base game, so I don't know if or how much it was better before the Phantom Liberty Patch. Now it's basically a fancy shiny interactive 3D visual novel.
The Perksystem is so basic and straightforward, there are no choices other then the most basics. Assaultrifles/SMGs? Reflexes, left part. Tech Weapons? Technical Ability, right part. Want stealth? Cool, middle part. Movement? Reflexes, middle part. So choose your weapon type and play style and your done, the only variety is in the order you will take your perks.
I read there once was a crafting system. If you are here for that, turn around, it's a lie. You can disassemble items into scrap of its tier and you need a certain amount to upgrade iconics and thats all the important stuff.
Clothing is only for decoration of a character you nearly never see, for gameplay it's irrelevant. I read there was once more to it, but it got scrapped, because. Sad.
Now I could probably go on but let's cut this short.

"Depois do anúncio do remake, fiquei com bastante vontade de conhecer Persona 4, até então eu havia jogado o 5 e 3, mas sempre vi por aí muitas pessoas (muitas mesmo) dizendo como elas preferiam este jogo, sendo por seus personagens, história, música, vibes, etc. Depois de ter zerado, consigo entender completamente de onde todo esse amor vem, assim como os outros jogos da franquia, esse jogo tem aquele mesmo [u]carisma[/u] dos outros, sabe? Esse joghttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1113000/Persona_4_Golden/#o com certeza deixou uma marca em mim, assim como os outros deixaram.

Os personagens com certeza são o ponto mais alto desse jogo, todos os seus companheiros são bem presentes durante a história, e com exceção de um, todos são bem agradáveis de fazer os social links e assistir eles interagindo entre si, esse jogo inteiro passa uma vibe muito mais ''alegre'' do que todos os outros e você sente bastante isso em todo mundo. Eles tem bastante aquela energia de ''amizade boba de amigos de um anime de escola'' e mesmo que isso dava uma cansada em alguns pontos da história, eu ainda curti.

Dito isso, [spoiler]Meu Deus como eu fiquei de saco cheio do Teddie várias vezes. Acho que isso é simplesmente um estilo de humor que os japoneses gostam que não desce em mim, mas esse negócio de ficar, ''nossa, eu quero muito ver minhas amigas ficarem peladas e namorar com elas, haha!'' começa a encher o saco. Se fosse uma vez ou outra eu não veria problema, esses momentos fazem parte dos outros jogos também, mas depois de um tempo, parece que o Teddie só consegue abrir a boca pra falar disso, e as vezes ficava até pior já que o Yosuke entrava nessa pira junto. Depois da metade pro fim do jogo, eu só tava achando ele muito esquisitão do que qualquer outra coisa.[/spoiler] Bom, mas excluindo essa parte, gostei bastante dos personagens!

A história do jogo consegue te prende bastante, principalmente da metade pro fim, onde todas as peças do mistério começam a se encaixar, sempre que eu abria o jogo eu ficava naquela mini ansiedade pra saber o que iria acontecer em seguida, e adorei o antagonista principal, provavelmente meu personagem favorito do jogo inteiro!

Toda a estética do jogo no combate, nas músicas e quando você está só passeando na cidade construindo os social links é muito marcante, era muito normal eu simplesmente ficar balançando a cabeça no ritmo da música enquanto eu jogava. Quanto ao combate, joguei o jogo inteiro no difícil e foi um desafio bem agradável pra mim que sempre deixar os jogos um pouco mais difíceis que o normal, vencer os bosses principais era bem satisfatório.

Em geral, jogo muito bom! Entendo como esse foi o jogo que realmente colocou a Atlus no mapa e como ele conseguiu tocar tantas pessoas, se você jogou e gostou de ter jogado tanto o 3 quanto o 5, aqui tem tudo que você gosta!",0.16833333333333333,1752880187,True,1113000

"-for me the game was good enough the campaign was decently good missions were fun and was some action in them but still they dont compare to the old cods (mw2 2009,mw3 2011) 

-multiplayer mehhh didnt play so much but had potential very much potential cause mw2 2022 was kinda trash with the multiplayer and warzone so i expected much more from this one

-zombies it was unexpected to have zombies in a call of duty mw game but i enjoyed it still as i said above had potential but you could have made levels fast on the guns there and so on (nothing compares with black ops zombies btw)

-the guns,meh i mean the guns were decent lest say but i am glad they didnt make them worse

-warzone loved it the maps very nice beacuse in cod mw 2 2022 the warzone guns=trash,map=trash,metas=trash. and when i saw the gameplay and played the new warzone that launched with this game i fell in love with warzone again.

"I'm not really sure what to say, but if I had to give a straight answer I'd give the DLC a 7.5 to 8 out of 10.

I stopped listening to community thoughts and feedback the second the servers came online, and except for a few breaks- I played for about 12 to 13 hours till 3am in the morning doing just the story on legendary. Give or take a few hours, I tried to round down the time it took. I don't get where a lot of the hate is coming from, or why people are saying stuff like the 'ball mechanic' was shoved down their throat. Literally everyone I've seen that complains about says that line like they're reading a teleprompter on how to trash the DLC. I'm not saying they're wrong for having their opinions, it just feels more like people are confirmation biased that the DLC is bad, only looking for cracks that confirm their opinions. I'm not saying the DLC is perfect, but for blinding myself to expectations for a full day and just playing--I felt like I had a good time. I enjoyed the mechanics after I got used to them; and even if I was frustrated at some puzzles when I got stuck, I still enjoyed the fact they required any amount of brain power at all. Some of them--at least near the end of the campaign reminded me of Portal 2 puzzles. Now, not all of them were like that, but it was overall a good experience still.

I don't want to give an opinion on the other content, as one day in and I haven't even been able to touch anything but the story till now. I will say that once I got used to stuff like the Portal in the Director, I quite liked it. I think 'some' of the distaste people are having is just getting used to new things--could be wrong though. Uh- oh, check out the 'Primer' shader in the shop this week if you can. It looks pretty awesome--making a lot of things in-game look like you've stripped them of textures almost.

Regardless, just have fun playing the game. Sometimes it's a little disheartening to see people just not allowing themselves to do what they want and have fun.

"Most likely left to die, until probably the proverbial DLC, Dragon's Dogma 2 is a ca be a bit of a whimper. Carried solely by its combat and great graphics but falls quite far lore wise than expected.  On top of the weird performance issues, weird quest breaking that isn't fixable, since its an actual mechanic. 

DD2 leaves you wandering the history and scope of the world you travel in. Aside from the big quest, every side quest leaves you wanting more, and you never get it. Sometimes NPCs will show up to your house then ask you to walk them several miles across the entire map so they can give you a flower or some sh*t. please give me a ferrystone lol. 



What I did like was the exploration, but there isn't really anything to find out or anything of nuance that stays with the player. Caves feel terrifying, night even more so. 

After you reach a certain level every encounter is trivial at best. The use of light, elemental spells, are incredibly fun. The digging for materials? not fun. The story is almost there, you do cool things like meet up with the most beautiful character in gaming, dress up to sneak into a party, break into a jail but there's no stealth component so its just weird. 

NPCs are cut from the same cloth, never really say anything substantial or new. The same applies to your pawns, who ridiculously point out endlessly, that you need to read this notice on the wall, except its the same notice written, 4 hours before, and 100 hours before also.

What it does excel at is combat, and sometimes you get your ass handed to you after just powering through every encounter. The world is full of half realized ideas, there is so much here that could be found, but never is. 
The combat is great though, it feel quite good when you fight something tough. Kiting a troll or cyclops towards a bridge or into a pile of rocks. However this truly stops being unique or cool 30 hours in. The world is extremely pretty and the characters are really decent looking, just wished it had more to give. The class system is big, and includes a surprise one that really makes the game fun.

The AI of enemies is quite aggressive but not very tough after a certain point. Eventually, you will be running around or teleportation to avoid the same encounters, you'll go into this deep cave and find pretty useless gear half the time. I don't expect to strike rich every time but Jesus. I don't need them to be Dark Souls tough but overall I expected enemies to behave more erratically and unpredictably. 

What I do like is how it does not hold your hand, sometimes to a devastating extreme. Don't use an unique item, since it doesn't warn you you can only use it once. The character creator is GREAT however, depending on your build the armor can look absolutely awful, like cosplay. 

While I do think it is worth playing on a deep sale, the first year anniversary had no update, nothing new to add, the creator of it left capcom. We are sitting here still with no answers if any of the broken quests, npc's will be fixed or even adding some flair to your personal pawn to make him idk, less stupid and more quest useful. Overall, DD2 is not as lovable and interesting as the first one, considering we waited like 12 years for this sequel once that rose tinted glasses come off, it just disappointing.

Now: Should you play this game? Yeah. ""after all that you said?"" yeah. DD2 is a very rare game in a sea of soulslike and FPS. It has the right balance to where I do enjoy it even though I am criticizing it. I recommend waiting for a steep sale, and that your rig can run it.

What does this game need to make it better?
More performance optimizations.
More lore and make pawns actually useful when questing.
Obviously a DLC of some sort and not like ""collaborations""
Better armor design for custom Arisen that better fits their body type.

Overall this game is fun, but it can really punish you whether its your fault or not. It looks great, I still hate not being able to like, set ladders or something. Or like you pawn helping you by casting float. I will eventually fully finish it when we get a bit more fixes bc im almost there but didn't feel like walking to the end of the world to get another bouquet of flowers.",0.11354976841340478,1752878953,True,2054970

"Dragon’s Dogma 2 is one of those rare games that divides opinion. If it clicks with you, it might just become one of your all-time favorites. But if it’s not your thing, it could easily feel frustrating or tedious. I fell in love with the original years ago, and it’s still one of my favorite games ever. I’ve now finally completed the sequel – life got in the way at launch, but I made sure to come back to it.

From start to finish, you can feel the passion the developers poured into this world. Dragon’s Dogma 2 isn’t just another generic RPG – it’s crafted to be something special, something that values player freedom over hand-holding narratives. I spent around 60 hours just exploring before I even touched the main story. The moment the world opened up, I wandered off, chasing adventure wherever it led me. By the time I got around to the story, I was around level 40; by the time I faced the final boss, I was level 80 and obliterated him in a single strike. Sure, it was anticlimactic in one way – but it also felt completely earned, and honestly, a little funny.

And that wasn’t even the end. With the help of the mysterious “Dungeon Master” (= Pathfinder), I dove into the true ending – a final chapter that perfectly encapsulates what makes this game special. No markers, no guides – just you, your instincts, and the world. Without spoiling anything, I can say the true ending is a brilliant tribute and love letter to game design itself.

So, do I recommend Dragon’s Dogma 2? That depends on you. If you enjoy games like Dark Souls, where discovery and freedom take precedence, this might be exactly your style. If you prioritize engaging mechanics and exploration over deep storytelling, this could be a perfect fit. And if you’re simply looking for a game that feels genuinely unique, Dragon’s Dogma 2 is absolutely worth your time.

That said—if you don’t like having to figure things out yourself, or occasionally look things up online when you miss something crucial, this game probably isn’t for you. It expects you to get lost, to make mistakes, and to discover the world on your own terms. For the right player, that’s exactly the magic of it.",0.1914806547619048,1752874855,True,2054970

"aaaaaaa DLC:  Que complemento legal e maneiro de se jogar , alguns falaram em 10 horas de gameplay pra mim que joguei tranquilo durou pouco mais de 20hr so curtinho e admirando o game lindo, cenarios diferentes  que experiencia fodastica eu recomendo muito. Para quem gostou do jogo Base acha que a dlc nao vale a pena pelo preco sim esta salgada o valor mais eu compraria para mim presentiar se caso gostasse.

Sobre o GAME:  implementando novas armas , quest legais tambem. Oque eu achei mais fodastisco foi ter a volta ao passado suas descorbertas , A lea acho que foi uma peca bem legal entre todos do jogo bonita,estilosa e uma bela espreitadora , mas outra personagem me deixou intrigante no caso a Rosalia pelo que eu entendi ela vivia ou esteve presente por Krat mas como ela foi tomada por titeres nao durou muito , acredito que o passado ficou mais conectado com a historia principal do que o proprio jogo Base oque e claro em uma DLC simplesmente achei muito fodaaaa.
 As barracas de jogos,  as manilevas deixadas tambem acho que nao da pra passar batido esses detalhes pra quem quer curtir o jogo , sem ruchar e maraviloso obrigado Round8 e Neowiz Games que OBRA PRIMA!!! TOOOP DE MAISSSSSSS...

极化了本体的特点，更多且更视觉丰富的袖珍黑魂地图、更多需要弹反处理的敌人，如果喜欢本体，那么这就是个中杯上的DLC；而想我一样，对本体并无太多好感的玩家，只会觉得更加恶心。地图立体但是单连通，公式化添加一个只对打BOSS有意义的捷径，刚准备探索就发现已经结束了；机械式的利用弹反替代了血源的枪法，但却本身弹反机制却做不到枪反这样低风险，又不像只狼有多条命的容错，敌人又增加了很多追击攻击来强迫你用弹反。初见我打每个敌人都有30%概率无伤打死，30%概率消耗1~2瓶药打过，30%概率被一脚踢死，外加10%被踢死后直接 ALT+F4退游,0.0,1752853062,False,2848330

"So where to begin with why this is a downgrade. 

I bought the 2022 version years back and saw there were several new features that I wanted to try for the 2025 version so I ended up buying it. 

1: Stylized Filter
2: Better Font Importing System
3: Spline Based Texturing for things like laces
- for starters

Well... its a downgrade for many reasons
1: Importing assets - WHY ON EARTH did you make it to where you have to toggle each individual box to import assets like alphas, materials, etc. I work with a studio and we have 100+ assets and there is no 'select all' button for alphas or for other importing features and you have to toggle..each..individual...piece. 
2: They changed layers to look like material spheres in the layers panel when in previous versions it was a box showing the color. This was a HUGE downgrade because now you struggle to see what color is in the layer and it clutters up the layers panel with bad clutter. <<< BIG THING YOU NEED TO REVERT
3: The 2025 version has a LOT more bugs, specifically with masks. I use the moss mask and other masks and if you drop a smart mask onto any layer, material, etc. The smart material just creates a new layer or bugs in many different ways. Huge problem. 
4: The stylized filter - We have seen it in teasers, youtubers, etc. This was the reason I got the 2025 version and it is VERY beta. Nearly 20 different filters and seems like only 5 of them works somewhat and the results vary greatly between models for things like hand painted filter. 
5: Performance - the 2022 version of substance runs MUCH better at idle and in action than the 2025 version. I run with a 5060TI and 32GB of Ram with this program on an SSD and there are issues with performance drops and other hiccups. 
6: The UI has log errors pop up as its own tab and personal settings for docking appear to glitch a lot and revert back to Adobe standard. Gets annoying when you work for a studio and you are opening 20-30 assets a day to work on a game engine. 

Overall: There are some cool flashy features, but SWEET FANCY MOSES Adobe why did so much get changed for the negative including rampant bugs. You charge 200$ for a perpetual license or a 25$ sub for something that has a lot of issues. 

Going to run my 2025 version but if I want to try and do some stylized filters or more custom stuff I will just use 2025 despite the bad performance.",0.0789908008658009,1752367738,False,3366290

"ВНИМАНИЕ! Если вы ,вдохновившись My Summer Car или Voices of the void, искали игру с меланхоличным геймплеем, и атмосферой одиночества посреди пустыни. А именно такие ассоциации вызывает словосочетание, Заправка по среди пустыни. ЭТА ИГРА ВАМ НЕ ПОДОЙДЕТ!

Авторы игры считают, что если оставить игрока в спокойствии на 20 секунд, то игроку станет скучно и он  удалит игру. Поток машин сравним не с пустыней, а с МКАДом в ЧасПик. И не верьте игре, которая говорит, что количество клиентов зависит от рейтинга вашей станции. Оно зависит от количества бензоколонок, количества парковок, и количества товаров. Пример: Когда колонка одна, заправку ждут 2 клиента, когда колонки 3, заправку ждут 4-5 клиентов. За 30 игровых дней, я уходил от станции дальше склада 3 раза. 
Когда надо было включить генератор в первую ночь.
Когда надо было спуститься к Густаву по квесту.
И когда я запрыгнул в кабриолет к симпатичной брюнетке, и планировал умчатся в закат из этого ада.

Игра в теории имела огромный потенциал, меланхолия, мистика и атмосфера одиночества. И мистика тут есть, как призрак или НЛО, но вместо крипоты, это унылый декор, который использовал СИМС еще лет 20 назад. Игра из перспективы быть атмосферным симулятором превращена в Кликкер. Веселая ферма, только в 3Д.

В защиту игры, скажу, что хоть это и Кликкер, но кликкер не плохой. Геймплей затягивает, атмосфера и саунддизайн хороши. Моя оценка не объективна, потому что от игры я ждал другого. И она не оправдала моих ожиданий.",0.0,1752593501,False,1149620

The humor was a huge highlight for me. The AI girls were hilarious and full of personality, and the random in-game ads were so unexpectedly funny — I found myself laughing way more than I expected. It gave the game a unique charm that really stood out.

The only downside was the platforming. Sometimes when jumping between platforms, it felt like tiny ""micro-pixels"" or edge detection issues caused my character to miss the jump or fail to grab a ledge, which could be frustrating. But aside from that, everything else was fantastic!

"[b]'후즈 앳더 도어'[/b]는 한눈에 보이는 관찰각도, 짧은 동선, 스토리와 연계되는 단서가 되는 환각과 같이 효율적인 덜어내기를 통해 짧은 플레이 타임에도 연출적인 부분을 채워넣는 여유를 보이며 시뮬레이션 시도만으로 종결되는 수많은 '8번 출구 박물관'식 게임들 사이에서 자신만의 스타일을 정립하는 부류의 게임이었습니다. 미스터리한 흐름으로 흘러가다 자연스럽게 마무리되며 다음으로 이어지는 회차 플레이에는 명확한 명분이 있었고, 큰 방해요소 없이 클라이맥스를 향해가는 구성도 좋았습니다.

공포의 형태는 뻔하지만은 않고 블러 처리 옵션(!)이 달릴 정도로 꽤 자극적인 부분도 있었습니다. 물론 그렇다고 굉장한 트라우마를 주는 수준의 공포까지는 아니고, 적당한 텐션, 적당한 징그러움, 매우 유효한 점프스케어들 몇몇이 만족감을 주는 편입니다.

환각 구분 판정에 있어서 한두군데 애매한 구간이 존재하기도 했습니다. 여기에 시간차로 판정이 바뀌는 경우도 존재했기 때문에 대체로 끝까지 확인을 하고 판단해야 했지만 플레이타임이 크게 늘어나는 부분은 아니었고, 구분 실패시에도 이상현상 카운트는 적용됐기 때문에 넘어갈 수 있습니다. 일부 지리하고 자잘한 틀린그림 찾기도 존재합니다만 적은 영역을 차지하고, 스트레스를 받거나 크게 신경쓰이지도 않습니다.

굳이 뭔가 더 궁금하거나 곱씹어보는 저같은 사람들을 제외하면 플레이 타임은 대체로 1.5~2.5시간 정도로 예상됩니다.

"This game totally sucked me in. I got it thinking, “Oh cool, I’ll build a cute zoo and vibe with the animals.” Next thing I know, it’s 2 am and I’m googling what pets go well together in google.

Planet Zoo is genuinely one of the best management/building games I’ve played. The animals are ridiculously detailed—like, they have personalities and little quirks, and it makes your zoo feel alive. I’ve caught myself just sitting there watching the elephants play in the water. No shame.

The building system is super powerful. It’s not easy at first (honestly, it humbled me), but once you figure it out, you can make some insane stuff. Total creative freedom. Want to build a fully themed rainforest sanctuary with custom signs and ambient sounds? Go for it. Want to just plop down pre-built stuff and focus on running the zoo? That works too.

What I didn’t expect was how much thought goes into caring for the animals. You have to learn what each species needs to be happy—terrain, space, food, social groups, enrichment, all of it. It’s detailed, but in a fun, addicting way. Also, there’s conservation goals and education stuff woven in, which I actually really liked. Makes it feel meaningful, not just like a zoo tycoon game from 2004.

Is it perfect? Not quite. The interface can feel a little overwhelming at first, and building with 1,000 pieces can get a little fiddly. But the game keeps getting updated, and the community is awesome if you ever need help or inspiration.

If you’re into animals, building sims, or just want to create your dream zoo (and stress about habitat temperatures), this game is 100% worth it. Highly recommend.",0.1585725308641975,1752860678,True,703080

"Good game (when it works ; don't expect much stability over updates if you play on linux).

However, for those who have played the original game, or its extended edition, this will feel like a dimmer, sketchier version. Hence my negative review.

Dimmer, because, well : the original game was colorful, illustrations of powers, gods, techs, environments and light works, were colorful and evocative. Retold replaced all that with what i would at times almost call grimdark fantasy, or at the very least very generic, maybe dull, and sometimes off-topic. The overall feeling is like the game wants to be edgy/serious, instead of being what it is, ie fun and lighted. Even in the overall environments and game assets, i feel a tone down of color that also makes reading difficult.

The sketchy part comes from a, much, much more demanding game engine that will just provide you with higher quality graphics showing lower quality art (again, dimmer, duller). It is to me all but a good tradeoff. Original game and extended edition worked better on my 20 years old windows 7 computer, than Retold on my 1080 GTX-based gaming setup.",0.037925925925925925,1752866652,False,1934680

"JudgeSim, “Banana Republic” adlı kurgusal bir adada hakim rolüne büründüğünüz, metin tabanlı bir simülasyon oyunu. Davaları okuyor, delilleri inceliyor, sanıklarla konuşuyor ve hukuki kararlar veriyorsunuz.

Artılar:

    Sürükleyici davalar: Her vaka ilgi çekici ve dikkatli okuma, çözümleme gerektiriyor. Davalar metinle anlatıldığı için zihin gücü ön planda ve kararlar ciddi hissettiriyor .

    Tekrar oynanabilirlik: Farklı sonuçlara ulaşmak, yargılamalardaki farklı yolları keşfetmek tekrar etmek için motive ediyor .

    Minimalist atmosfer: Grafikler basit, ama bu metin odaklı oynanışa katkıda bulunuyor. Phoenix Wright kadar çarpıcı değil ama türünde başarılı
    Epic Games Store
    .

Eksiler:

    Monoton müzik: Müzikler kısa ve çabuk tekrara düşüyor; bazı kullanıcılar sıkıcı bulabiliyor .

    Şans faktörü: Bazen davaların ve ceza sonuçlarının tamamen zar atışına dayandığı anlar var ki bu, temelde beceriye dayalı yargılamayla çakışabiliyor .

    Basit görsel stil: Kağıt üzerinde hazırlanmış gibi duran grafikler, bazı oyunculara “Papers, Please” benzeri ama daha zayıf bir deneyim sunuyor.",0.1,1752703993,True,2919660

"買うという判断をした自分を褒めたい。
3対7くらいで買うべきですねこれ。

・アパート生活が出来る (一部普通の家区画や屋上のベントハウス区画もある)
　アパートから直接広場に行くことが出来て(ロードなしで)イベントなどもあって楽しい
　ただし自分でアパートを作ることはできない (これがしたいならFor rent バグあるらしいけど)
・世界の料理が追加される
　日本のにぎり(寿司)やラーメン、インドのカレーやベトナムのフォーなどが屋台で売られている
・仕事の追加
　政治活動家や評論家、ソーシャルメディアで有名人になれるんだそう(あまりやれてない)
・趣味などの追加
　バスケやカラオケが出来るようになる 歌唱スキルも追加される
・家具追加
　完全に新しい家具に加えて、一部の家具に価格が安い中古版が登場した
　ド貧乏な序盤や建築勢はうれしいかもしれない
　ついでに自分で物を売れるテーブルが追加され、ヤードセールが出来る
・区画チャレンジや特質の追加
　勉強がはかどる特質や家具が突然全部壊れる区画チャレンジなどがどこでも遊べる
　区画チャレンジを遊んでちょっぴりハードなゲーム体験もできる
　{(イメージ) 泥棒が頻繁に現れ、家具は頻繁に壊れる上にゴーストが現れるカオス区画が作れる}
  +ちなみにマップは別に悪くない そこそこ遊べそう

ちょっと不安・微妙
・セーブするときなどの挙動が若干重い気がする
・アパートの外の広場へはロードなしでいけるのに、隣人宅へはロードが必要
・建築モードで家具を入れ替えるとき、壁に掛けられている家具がとりにくい見にくい
　その結果、建築するときストレスがかかる

"Давний фанат серии игр Ассасин Крид. Как фанат серии могу сказать, что Вальгалла не самый плохой представитель серии. У него есть свои недостатки, по большей части связанные с технического характера проблемами такие, как вылеты на рабочий стол (довольно регулярные, однако их периодичность не сказывается на общем впечатлении от продукта, ибо они могут возникнуть скажем после 4 часов игры, неприятно, но можно смириться), баги, связанные с коллизией текстур таких, как прохождение причесок через одежду (особенно тех которые задействуют сложные прически с длинными бородами и волосами, выглядит комично когда козлинная борода на Эйворе улетает вверх из-за одежды). Приходилось даже выбирать короткие прически и бороды, чтобы этот косяк не был особо заметен. 
В остальном добротная история, которая правда ничем не заканчивается ибо финал истории либо в ДЛС про мифологию Асгарда находится, либо разработчики решили оставить финал истории не завершенным. Такая фишка как я понял в последних играх серии часто используется.
Открытый мир по моим ощущениям больше походит на Ориджин, где каждая территория имеет свой уровень и уровень врагов схож с уровнем территории. Истории каждой конкретной территории, которые захватывает Эйвор различаются по качеству. Где-то надо провести расследование, чтобы установить личности тех кого требуется устранить, их интересно выполнять, где-то сюжетка завязана чисто на битвах без какойто толики саспенса и интересных сюжетных постановочных катсцен. По моим прикидкам 70/30 в процентном соотношении интересных и неинтересных сюжетов территорий. Тут впринципе сюжетных катсцен маловато, в основном все сделано на движке игры и подвержено логике обычного разговора с НПС. 
Делая итог, я наиграл 150 часов основного сюжета и двух длс к нему, связанного с Ирландией и Франкией, не касался сильно побочных заданий в виде мировых событий, коллектаблс, и иных побочных ивентов. Играть было интересно хотя под конец в основном утомительно. Но так или иначе игра стоит того, чтобы с ней ознакомится. Хотя бы ради сеттинга и прекрасных видов, разработчики старались передать дух Скандинавии и Англии 10 века и это заметно.",0.0,1752350000,True,2208920
"Ой, ну что тут сказать. 
 Ну не старый ассасин и не совсем новый. Вот что-то посередине с уклоном в худшую сторону. Как хорошое игровое произведение, то тут сразу можно сказать, что точно нет. Этой игре очень далеко до по-настоящему интересных историй и уникального геймплея.
 Но вот почему отзыв положительный? Ну так собственно не все игры обязаны быть тем самым бэнгером на все года, хотя то что это часть великой серии история другая. Эта та самая игра, в которой просто хочется подеградитровать или поставить уже её на фон, а не видосик/подкастик. В целом такие игры иногда уж и нужны. И именно в таком контексте игра вполне справляется, а раз уж поставленная задача выполнена, то и судить не за что. Ну вы же не смотрите ужастики ради истории или операторской работы, хотя и такие есть. Ну вот и эта игра не пытаться быть художественным произведением, а просто развлечением.
